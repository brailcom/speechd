@cindex Philosophy

The Speech Dispatcher project provides a device independent layer for
speech synthesis. It provides a simple interface for client
applications (applications, that want to speak) as well as for device
driver modules (the different speech synthesizers).

High quality speech synthesis has been available for a long time and
now it's usable even by ordinary users on their home PC's. It is a good
feature, and sometimes mandatory, for programs to
provide speech output.  There is a wide field of possible uses from
educational software, to specialized systems (hospitals,
laboratories).  For visually impaired users it is one of the two
essential ways of getting output from a computer (the second one is
a Braille display). This is also where Speech Dispatcher helps.

There are different speech synthesizers with different capabilities.
Some of them are hardware, some of them are software.  Some of them
are Free Software and are are available on the Internet.  Programmers
have really hard times when they want to make their program speak
because they need to find a suitable synthesizer (long hours of
experimentation and so on...) and then make it work with their program.
They often need to write output device drivers for these programs or
hardware devices and are doing it again and again.  You can imagine it
all fails when an innocent user simultaneously executes two programs with
speech output --- if both even start (which I doubt), they will
be talking one over the other.  This makes it very hard for
programmers to implement speech support in their programs (for blind
users or simply to make a better user interface) and it's one of the
reasons we still don't fully exploit what speech synthesis technology
offers.

In an ideal world, programmers would use the same commands for speech
synthesis as they do for normal text output (printf, puts, ...).  In an
ideal world, there would be a speech_printf() function that would take care of
saying a message at the right time without interrupting others, without
them being obligated to take care of how exactly the communication with
speech synthesizer is implemented, and without them having to worry about
what synthesizer to use and if it's available.  In an ideal world, there
would be a speech synthesizer in each GNU/Linux distribution and some
common interface taking care of all applications that want to speak,
allowing users to configure speech parameters and providing a simple interface
(as speech_printf()) through a shared library for programmers.  It will
be a long way until we achieve this state of things, but with Speech
Dispatcher, we are taking the first steps...

@node Basic Design, Features Overview, Motivation, Introduction
@section Design
@cindex Design

@heading Current Design        
The communication between all applications and synthesizers, when
implemented directly, is a mess. For this purpose, we wanted
Speech Dispatcher to be a layer separating applications and
synthesizers so that applications wouldn't have to care about
synthesizers and synthesizers wouldn't have to care about interaction
with applications.

We decided we would implement Speech Dispatcher as a server receiving
commands from applications over a protocol called @code{SSIP},
parsing them if needed, and calling the appropriate functions
of output modules communicating with the different synthesizers.
These output modules are implemented as plug-ins, so that the user
can just load a new module if he wants to use a new synthesizer.

Each client (application that wants to speak) opens a socket
connection to Speech Dispatcher and calls functions like say(),
stop(), and pause() provided by a library implementing the protocol.
This shared library is still on the client side and sends Speech
Dispatcher SSIP commands over the socket. When the messages arrive
at Speech Dispatcher, it parses them, reads the text that should
be said and puts it in one of several queues according to the priority
of the message and other criteria. It then decides when,
with which parameters (set up by the client and the user),
and on which synthesizer it will say the message. These requests
are handled by the output plug-ins (output modules) for different
hardware and software synthesizers and then said aloud.

@image{figures/architecture,155mm,,Speech Dispatcher architecture}

@heading Future Design

Speech Dispatcher currently mixes two important features: common
low-level interface to multiple speech synthesizers and message
management (including priorities and history). This became even more
evident when we started thinking about handling messages intended for
output on braille devices.  Such messages of course need to be
synchronized with speech messages and there is little reason why the
accessibility tools should send the same message twice for
these two different kinds of output used by blind people (often
simultaneously).

In near future, we would like to split Speech Dispatcher into two
independent components: one providing a low-level interface to
speech synthesis drivers, which we now call TTS API Provider, and the
second doing message managemenet, some Message Dispatcher. This will
allow Message Dispatcher to also output on Braille.

While a good API and its implementation for Braille are already
existent in the form of BrlAPI, the API for speech is now under active
developement. Please see another architecture diagram showing how we
imagine Message Dispatcher in the future.

@node Current State,  , Features Overview, Introduction
@section Current State
@cindex Synthesizers
@cindex Other programs

In this version, most of the features of Speech Dispatcher are
implemented and we believe it is now useful for applications as a
device independent Text-to-Speech layer and an accessibility message
coordination layer.

Currently, one of the most advanced applications that works with
Speech Dispatcher is @code{speechd-el}. This is a client for Emacs,
targeted primarily for blind people. It is similar to Emacspeak,
however the two take a bit different approach and serve different user
needs. You can find speechd-el on
@uref{http://www.freebsoft.org/speechd-el/}. speechd-el provides
speech output when using nearly any GNU/Linux text interface, like
editing text, reading email, browsing the web, etc.

It's possible to use Speakup, the kernel-based screen reader, with
software speech using the @code{speechd-up} package and Speech
Dispatcher.

Orca, the primary screen reader for the Gnome Desktop, supports Speech
Dispatcher directly since its version 2.19.0.  See
@uref{http://live.gnome.org/Orca/SpeechDispatcher} for more
information.

There is also a bridge for Gnome Speech, which makes Speech Dispatcher
visible as one of the available synthesizers in the Gnome Speech
subsystem, but this method is currently deprecated in favor of direct
Speech Dispatcher backend in Orca (but may be still the only solution
with older ATs, such as Gnopernicus).

We also provide a shared C library, a Python library and a Common Lisp
library that implement the SSIP functions of Speech Dispatcher in a
higher level interface, so writing client applications in these
languages should be quite easy. 

On the synthesis side, there is good support for Festival. Festival
is a Free Software multi-language Text-to-Speech synthesis system,
that is very flexible and extensible using the Scheme scripting
language. Currently, it supports high quality synthesis for several
languages (English, Czech, Italian, Spanish, Russian, Polish...), and
on today's computers it runs reasonably fast.  See
@uref{http://www.cstr.ed.ac.uk/projects/festival/}. The Speech
Dispatcher output module for Festival is highly optimized for fast
responsivity.

For simpler purposes, there is also support for Flite and eSpeak who
currently only support English. Flite (Festival Light) is a
lightweight free software TTS synthesizer intended to run on systems
with limited resources. At this time, it has only one English voice
and porting voices from Festival looks rather difficult.  With the
caching mechanism provided by Speech Dispatcher, Festival is even
faster than Flite in many situations.  See
@uref{http://www.speech.cs.cmu.edu/flite/}. eSpeak is a newer very
lightweight free software engine with a good quality of voice at high
rates. See @uref{http://espeak.sourceforge.net/}.

Speech Dispatcher also offers support for the non-free Cicero and IBM
TTS. Also generic output devices are supported, which means that
basically any Text-to-Speech program that provides a simple command
line interface can be used with Speech Dispatcher after a little bit
of tuning in the configuration file. This kind of output module
provides only limited functionality, but it can be useful if there are
no other choices for your language. Configuration files for Epos,
Dectalk software and (experimental) LiaPhon are shipped with Speech
Dispatcher.

We decided not to support the simple hardware devices ourselves,
because they don't support synchronization and therefore have serious
problems when handling multiple messages.  Also they are not extensible,
they are usually expensive and often hard to support. Today's computers
are fast enough to perform software speech synthesis and Festival is a
great example. It seems the public still percieves software synthesis
as slow, therefore inferior to hardware synthesis. Even Festival is
often cited as slow. According to our experience, this is mostly due
to inappropriate interfacing and processing of the results. Festival
itself doesn't consume more than about 30% CPU (in peaks) on a 1500MHz
machine. This shows that CPU power is no longer the limiting factor for
speech synthesis.

Currently, there is no application that would serve as a configuration 
manager for Speech Dispatcher. We think of this application as a client
of Speech Dispatcher, where a user can modify all the parameters of
connections, browse history, modify settings in a permanent
text file configuration and so on. We welcome anyone who would like to
help us with such a client.

@subsection Multiple Output Modules
@cindex output module
@cindex different synthesizers

Speech Dispatcher supports concurrent use of multiple output modules.  If the
output modules provide good synchronization, you can combine them when
reading messages.  For example if module1 can speak English and Czech while
module2 speaks only German, the idea is that if there is some message in
German, module2 is used, while module1 is used for the other languages.
However the language is not the only criteria for the decision.  The rules for
selection of an output module can be influenced through the configuration file
@file{speech-dispatcher/speechd.conf}.

@subsubsection Provided functionality

Please note that some output modules don't support the full Speech
Dispatcher functionality (e.g. spelling mode, sound icons). If there
is no easy way around the missing functionality, we don't try to
emulate it in some complicated way and rather try to encourage the
developers of that particular synthesizer to add that
functionality. We are actively working on adding the missing parts to
Festival, so Festival supports nearly all of the features of Speech
Dispatcher and we encourage you to use it.

@node Supported Modules, Compiling a New Module , Provided Functionality, Multiple Output Modules
@subsubsection Supported Modules

Currently, these output modules are supported: Festival, Flite, Epos
and Generic.

@itemize

@item Festival
Festival is a free software multi-language Text-to-Speech 
synthesis system that is very flexible and extensible using the
Scheme scripting language. Currently, it supports high quality
synthesis for several languages, and on today's computers it runs
reasonably fast.  If you are not sure which one to use and your
language is supported by Festival, we advise you to use it. See
@uref{http://www.cstr.ed.ac.uk/projects/festival/}.

@item Flite 
Flite (Festival Light) is a lightweight free software TTS synthesizer
intended to run on systems with limited resources. At this time, it
has only one English voice and porting voices from Festival looks
rather difficult.  With the caching mechanism provided by Speech
Dispatcher, Festival is faster than Flite in most situations.  See
@uref{http://www.speech.cs.cmu.edu/flite/}.

@item Generic
The Generic module can be used with any synthesizer that can be
managed by a simple command line application. @xref{Configuration of
the Generic Output Module}, for more details about how to use it.
However, it provides only very rudimentary support of speaking.

@end itemize

@node Compiling a New Module ,  , Supported Modules, Multiple Output Modules
@subsubsection Compiling a New Module 

If you want to compile and use a new output module, you should place
it in @file{src/modules} in your source directory for Speech Dispatcher
and add it to @file{src/modules/Makefile.am}. You can compile and
install it by typing: @code{make; su root; make install}. The last
step is to let Speech Dispatcher know that you want to
use this new module by adding at least these two lines to
@file{speech-dispatcher/speechd.conf} in your configuration
directory. @xref{AddModule}.

@example
AddModule "module_name" "binary" "configuration"
@end example

and possibly also changing the lines

@example
DefaultModule new_module
@end example

to make it the default output module or

@example
LanguageDefaultModule "en"  "new_module"
@end example

to make it the default for some language.

@node Client Specific Default Configuration, Security, Multiple Output Modules, Features
@subsection Client Specific Default Configuration

In Speech Dispatcher's configuration, it is possible to specify
default values for message parameters from different applications/users
that connect to it. For example, you can modify the configuration so
that your instant messenger always speaks notifications louder
by raising the volume.

For more details, @xref{Client Specific Configuration}.

@subsubsection User Authentication
@cindex Identification Protocol
@cindex identd
@cindex RFC 1413

NOTE: This feature is being implemented, however the current version
does not support it.

Speech Dispatcher does not provide any explicit authentication mechanism.  To
check the identity of users, Speech Dispatcher uses the Identification Protocol
mechanism defined by RFC 1413 to get the user's identity. 

@cindex user mapping
It is possible to specify user mapping in the configuration.  This allows
certain users to be considered the same and have the same rights (eg. to browse
their message history)  See @ref{Top,,Message History,ssip, SSIP Documentation}.

@node Access Rights to Message History,  , User Authentication, Security
@subsubsection Access Rights to Message History
@cindex access rights

NOTE: This feature is being implemented, however the current version
does not support it. For security reasons, history was turned off in
this release of Speech Dispatcher.

To protect privacy of users, Speech Dispatcher restricts history access to a
certain subset of all the received messages.  The following rules apply:

@itemize @bullet
@item
All the messages issued by a client connection are accessible to that
client connection.

@item
All the messages sent by a given user are accessible to that user.

@item
@cindex @code{speechd} user
@cindex @code{speechd} group
All the messages sent by the user @code{speechd} are accessible to all
users on the system running the Speech Dispatcher instance present in the
group @code{speechd}.

@item
No other messages are accessible.
@end itemize

Two users are considered the same, if and only if their connections originate
on the same host, their user names are the same, and their identity can be
checked, as described in @ref{User Authentication}.  If user's identity cannot
be checked, the user is considered different from all other connected or
previously connected users.


@node Installation, Running, Features, User's Documentation
@section Installation

This part only deals with the general aspects of installing
Speech Dispatcher. If you are compiling from source code (distribution
tarball or CVS), please refer to the file @file{INSTALL} in your
source tree.

@subsection The requirements 

You will need these components to run Speech Dispatcher:
@itemize
@item glib 2.0  (@uref{http://www.gtk.org})
@item libdotconf 1.0 (@uref{http://www.azzit.de/dotconf/})
@item pthreads
@end itemize

We recommend to also install these packages:
@itemize
 @item Festival (@uref{http://www.cstr.ed.ac.uk/projects/festival/})
 @item festival-freebsoft-utils 0.3+ (@uref{http://www.freebsoft.org/festival-freebsoft-utils})
 @item Sound icons library @* (@uref{http://www.freebsoft.org/pub/projects/sound-icons/sound-icons-0.1.tar.gz})
@end itemize

@subsection Recommended installation procedure

@itemize

@item Install your software synthesizer

Although we highly recommend to use Festival for its excellent
extensibility, good quality voices, good responsiveness and best
support in Speech Dispatcher, you might want to start with
Flite, a lightweight version of Festival, to get all the key
components working and only then switch to Festival. Installation of
Flite should be easier and the default configuration of Speech
Dispatcher is set up for Flite for this reason. However, if it is not
easy for you to install Flite (as your distribution doesn't provide
packages for it), then don't bother with it.

You can of course also start with Epos or any other supported synthesizer.

@item Make sure your synthesizer works

There is usually a way to test if the installation of your speech
synthesizer works. For Flite run @code{flite -t "Hello!"} and hear
the speech. For Festival run @code{festival} and type in

@example
(SayText "Hello!")
(quit)
@end example

@item Install Speech Dispatcher

Install the packages for Speech Dispatcher from your distribution or
download the source tarball (or CVS) from
@url{http://www.freebsoft.org/speechd} and follow the instructions in
the file @code{INSTALL} in the source tree.

@item Configure Speech Dispatcher

(If you have a working Flite installation on your system, you can now
skip to the next section, test if your installation of Speech
Dispatcher works, and then return to tweak the configuration.)

Go to @file{/etc/speech-dispatcher/speechd.conf} or similar (it might
be @file{/usr/local/etc/speech-dispatcher/speechd.conf} if you install
from sources) and edit the lines @code{AddModule},
@code{DefaultModule} and @code{LanguageDefaultModule} for your chosen
synthesizer. If you want to run Festival, just substitute 'Flite' for
'Festival' in the last two options.

Another thing you will likely want to change is the default rate of
speech (line @code{DefaultRate}). Return to this later to adjust
details.

Another important thing is to configure the output module you are
using. Go to @file{/etc/speech-dispatcher/festival.conf} or similar
according to the synthesizers you want to run. If supported, choose
your preferred audio output method through the option
@code{FestivalAudioOutputMethod} or similar. We highly recommend
@code{ALSA} audio output when supported. Review the other options.
If there is a '#' sign before the option, it
means it doesn't have any effect and its argument is its default
value.

@item Test Speech Dispatcher

The simplest way to test Speech Dispatcher is through the
@code{spd-say} tool.

Example:
@example
spd-say "Hello!"
spd-say -l cs -r 90 "Ahoj"
@end example

If you don't hear anything, please @xref{Troubleshooting}.

@end itemize

@node Running, Troubleshooting, Installation, User's Documentation
@section Running

Speech Dispatcher can be executed either as a system-wide system service
or on a per-user basis. While the first way allows speech output in early
boot stages and congregation of speech comming from applications running
under different system users, the second way provides more flexibility
in user configuration and is essential in an environment where multiple
people use the computer at the same time.

@end menu

@node Runnning as System Wide Service, Running Under Ordinary Users, Running, Running
@subsection Running as System Wide Service

To run Speech Dispatcher as a system wide service, if your
distribution supports Speech Dispatcher, most likely you will
only have to do:

@example
/etc/init.d/speech-dispatcher start
@end example

or it will even already be started automatically. Bellow follos a more
technical description.

When running Speech Dispatcher as a system wide service, it is
recommended to start it using an /etc/init.d/ script under a special
user and group, like 'speech-dispatcher'. This user must have read/write
permissions to access the PID directory (typically
/var/run/speech-dispatcher/), read permissions to the configuration
directory (typically /etc/speech-dispatcher/) and read/write permissions
to the logfile directory (typically /var/log/speech-dispatcher/).  The
listed typical path are prefixed with /usr/local/ when compiling the
package from source code and can be overridden using compilation flags.

@xref{Setting Communication Port}, for information about how to
change the communication port from the default 6560 to other
values.

@node Running Under Ordinary Users, Running in a Custom Setup, Runnning as System Wide Service, Running
@subsection Running Under Ordinary Users

Before running Speech Dispatcher under an ordinary user account, a
directory @file{.speech-dispatcher/conf/} should be created in the users
home folder and all the configuration files and directories should be
put here. If Speech Dispatcher is already installed system wide, this
is most easily done as 

@example
# mkdir ~/.speech-dispatcher
# mkdir ~/.speech-dispatcher/conf/
# cp -r /etc/speech-dispatcher/* ~/.speech-dispatcher/conf/
@end example

If @file{~/.speech-dispatcher/} is found by Speech Dispatcher on
startup, it will use the configuration placed here and ignore the
system-wide configuration. Also, it will create the @file{log/} and
@file{pid/} subdirectories in @file{~/.speech-dispatcher/} and use them
for its log files and pid files respectively. This behavior can only
be overriden directly by the command line options.

It is also necessary to change the communication port, since the default
6560 will most likely be used by a system-wide Speech Dispatcher. Please
read @xref{Setting Communication Port}.

@node Running in a Custom Setup, Setting Communication Port, Running Under Ordinary Users, Running
@subsection Running in a Custom Setup

Speech Dispatcher can be run in any other setup of executing users, port
numbers and system paths as well. The path to configuration, pidfile and
logfiles can be specified separately via compilation flags,
configuration file options or command line options in this ascending
order of their priority.

@node Setting Communication Port,  , Running in a Custom Setup, Running
@subsection Setting Communication Port

The default communication port between Speech Dispatcher and user
applications is 6560 and all applications know this port number as the
default to contact Speech Dispatcher. If you want to change it
however, you can do it in the configuration file speechd.conf or
through a command line option when executing the Speech Dispatcher
binary. In such a case, it will also be necessary to influence the
port used by the client applications (speechd-up, Orca, speechd-el,
...]. The most easy way to do so is via the @var{SPEECHD_PORT}
environment variable, which should be set to the value of the port in
use (e.g. as 'export SPEECHD_PORT=6561') before starting the client
program, although some programs offer another mechanism as well.

@node Troubleshooting, Configuration, Running, User's Documentation
@section Troubleshooting

If you are experiencing problems when running Speech Dispatcher, please:

@itemize
@item
Try to say some message through the utility @code{spd-say}.

Example:
@example
        spd-say "Hello, does it work?"
        spd-say --language=cs --rate=20 "Everything ok?"
@end example
@item
Check if your configuration files (speechd.conf, modules/*.conf) 
are correct (some uninstalled synthesizer specified as the default,
wrong values for default voice parameters etc.)
@item
Check @code{/var/log/speech-dispatcher/speech-dispatcher.log}. Look for lines
containing the string 'ERROR' and their surrounding contents. If you hear no
speech, restart Speech Dispatcher and look near the end of the log file --
before any attempts for synthesis of any message. Usually, if
something goes wrong with the initialization of the output modules, a
textual description of the problem and a possible solution can be
found in the log file.
@item
If you still can't find the cause of the problem and you are an
experienced user, you might want to enable the Debug option of your
output module in @code{etc/speech-dispatcher/modules/} and examine
@code{/var/log/speech-dispatcher/module_name.log}.

There is a know problem in Festival. Please make sure that Festival
server_access_list configuration variable and your /etc/hosts.conf are
set properly. server_access_list must contain the symbolic name of
your machine and this name must be defined in /etc/hosts.conf and
point to your IP address. You can test if this is set correctly by
trying to connect to the port Festival server is running on via an
ordinary telnet (by default like this: @code{telnet localhost
1314}). If you are not rejected, it works.

Speech Dispatcher can be configured on several different levels.  You
can configure the global settings through the server configuration file,
which can be placed either in the Speech Dispatcher default
configuration system path like /etc/speech-dispatcher/ or in your home
in ~/.speech-dispatcher, if you are running Dispatcher under an ordinary
user.  There is also support for per-client configuration, this is,
specifying different default values for different client applications.

Furthermore, applications often come with their own means of configuring
speech related settings.  Please see the documentation of your
application for details about application specific configuration.

@subsection Configuration file syntax

We use the DotConf library to read a permanent text-file based
configuration, so the syntax might be familiar to many users.

Each of the string constants, if not otherwise stated differently,
should be encoded in UTF-8. The option names use only the
standard ASCII charset restricted to upper- and lowercase characters
(@code{a}, @code{b}), dashes (@code{-}) and underscores @code{_}.

Comments and temporarily inactive options begin with @code{#}.
If such an option should be turned on, just remove the comment
character and set it to the desired value.
@example
# this is a comment
# InactiveOption "this option is turned off"
@end example

Strings are enclosed in doublequotes.
@example
LogFile  "/var/log/speech-dispatcher.log"
@end example

Numbers are written without any quotes.
@example
Port 6560
@end example

Boolean values use On (for true) and Off (for false).
@example
Debug Off
@end example

@node Configuration options, Client Specific Configuration, Configuration file syntax, Configuration
@subsection Configuration options

All available options are documented directly in the file and examples
are provided.  Most of the options are set to their default value and
commented out.  If you want to change them, just change the value and
remove the comment symbol @code{#}.

@node Client Specific Configuration, Output Modules Configuration, Configuration options, Configuration
@subsection Client Specific Configuration

It is possible to automatically set different default values of speech
parameters (e.g.  rate, volume, punctuation, default voice...) for
different applications that connect to Speech Dispatcher. This is
especially useful for simple applications that have no parameter
setting capabilities themselves or they don't support a parameter
setting you wish to change (e.g. language).

Using the commands @code{BeginClient "IDENTIFICATION"} and
@code{EndClient} it is possible to open and close a section of
parameter settings that only affects those client applications that
identify themselves to Speech Dispatcher under the specific
identification code which is matched against the string
@code{IDENTIFICATION}.  It is possible to use wildcards ('*' matches
any number of characters and '?' matches exactly one character) in the
string @code{IDENTIFICATION}.

The identification code normally consists of 3 parts:
@code{user:application:connection}. @code{user} is the username of the
one who started the application, @code{application} is the name of the
application (usually the name of the binary for it) and
@code{connection} is a name for the connection (one application might
use more connections for different purposes).

An example is provided in @code{/etc/speech-dispatcher/speechd.conf}
(see the line @code{Include "clients/emacs.conf"} and
@code{/etc/speech-dispatcher/clients/emacs.conf}.

@node Output Modules Configuration, Log Levels, Client Specific Configuration, Configuration
@subsection Output Modules Configuration

Each user should turn on at least one output module in his
configuration, if he wants Speech Dispatcher to produce
any sound output. If no output module is loaded, Speech Dispatcher
will start, log messages into history and communicate with clients,
but no sound is produced.

Each output module has an
``AddModule'' line in
@file{speech-dispatcher/speechd.conf}. Additionally, each output
module can have its own configuration file.

The audio output is handled by the output modules themselves, so this
can be switched in their own configuration files under
@code{etc/speech-dispatcher/modules/}.

@subsubsection Loading Modules in speechd.conf

@anchor{AddModule}
Each module that should be run when Speech Dispatcher starts must be loaded
by the @code{AddModule} command in the configuration. Note that you can load
one binary module multiple times under different names with different
configurations. This is especially useful for loading the generic output
module. @xref{Configuration of the Generic Output Module}.

@example
AddModule "@var{module_name}" "@var{module_binary}" "@var{module_config}"
@end example

@var{module_name} is the name of the output module.

@var{module_binary} is the name of the binary executable
of this output module. It can be either absolute or relative
to @file{bin/speechd-modules/}.

@var{module_config} is the file where the configuration for
this output module is stored. It can be either absolute or relative
to @file{etc/speech-dispatcher/modules/}. This parameter is optional.

@node Configuration files of output modules, Configuration of the Generic Output Module, Loading Modules in speechd.conf, Output Modules Configuration
@subsubsection Configuration Files of Output Modules

Each output module is different and therefore has different
configuration options. Please look at the comments in its
configuration file for a detailed description. However, there
are several options which are common for some
output modules. Here is a short overview of them.

@table @code
@item AudioOutputMethod
@anchor{AudioOutputMethod method}

When the module is able to use different methods of audio output for
the given synthesizer, you can choose between them using this command.

@var{method} is one of the strings 'alsa' for Advanced Linux Sound
Architecture, 'oss' for Open Sound System and 'nas' for Network Audio
Server. Please note that NAS support is only experimental and there
are known problems in NAS.

Sometimes there is an additional command in the configuration file
where you can specify additional parameters.

We recommend (e.g. for Festival:
@example
        FestivalAudioOutputMethod "alsa"
        FestivalALSADevice "default"        
@end example

@item AddVoice "@var{language}" "@var{symbolicname}" "@var{name}"
@anchor{AddVoice}

Each output module provides some voices and sometimes it even supports
different languages. For this reason, there is a common mechanism for
specifying these in the configuration, although no module is
obligated to use it. Some synthesizers, e.g. Festival, support the
SSIP symbolic names directly, so the particular configuration of these
voices is done in the synthesizer itself.

For each voice, there is exactly one @code{AddVoice} line.

@var{language} is the ISO language code of the language of this voice.

@var{symbolicname} is a symbolic name under which you wish this voice
to be available. See @ref{Top,,Standard Voices, ssip, SSIP
Documentation} for the list of names you can use.

@var{name} is a name specific for the given output module. Please see
the comments in the configuration file under the appropriate AddModule
section for more info.

For example our current definition of voices for Epos (file
@code{/etc/speech-dispatcher/modules/generic-epos.conf} looks like
this:

@example
        AddVoice        "cs"  "male1"   "kadlec"
        AddVoice        "sk"  "male1"   "bob"
@end example

@item ModuleDelimiters "@var{delimiters}", ModuleMaxChunkLength @var{length}

Normally, the output module doesn't try to synthesize all 
incoming text at once, but instead it cuts it into smaller
chunks (sentences, parts of sentences) and then synthesizes
them one by one. This second approach, used by some output
modules, is much faster, however it limits the ability of
the output module to provide good intonation.

NOTE: The Festival module does not use ModuleDelimiters and
ModuleMaxChunkLength.

For this reason, you can configure at which characters
(@var{delimiters}) the text should be cut into smaller blocks
or after how many characters (@var{length}) it should be cut,
if there is no @var{delimiter} found.

Making the two rules more strict, you will get better speed
but give away some quality of intonation. So for example
for slower computers, we recommend to include comma (,)
in @var{delimiters} so that sentences are cut into phrases,
while for faster computers, it's preferable
not to include comma and synthesize the whole compound
sentence.

The same applies to @code{MaxChunkLength}, it's better
to set higher values for faster computers.

For example, curently the default for Flite is

@example
    FestivalMaxChunkLength  500
    FestivalDelimiters  ".?!;"
@end example

The output module may also decide to cut sentences on delimiters
only if they are followed by a space. This way for example
``file123.tmp'' would not be cut in two parts, but ``The horse
raced around the fence, that was lately painted green, fell.''
would be. (This is an interesting sentence, by the way.)
@end table

@node Configuration of the Generic Output Module,  , Configuration files of output modules, Output Modules Configuration
@subsubsection Configuration files of the Generic Output Module

The generic output module allows you to easily write your
own output module for synthesizers that have a simple
command line interface by modifying the configuration
file. This way, users can add support for their device even if they don't
know how to program. @xref{AddModule}.

The core part of a generic output module is the command
execution line.

@defvr {Generic Module Configuration} GenericExecuteSynth "@var{execution_string}"

@code{execution_string} is the command that should be executed
in a shell when it's desired to say something. In fact, it can
be multiple commands concatenated by the @code{&&} operator. To stop
saying the message, the output module will send a KILL signal to
the process group, so it's important that it immediately
stops speaking after the processes are killed. (On most GNU/Linux
system, the @code{play} utility has this property).

In the execution string, you can use the following variables,
which will be substituted by the desired values before executing
the command.

@itemize
@item @code{$DATA}
The text data that should be said. The string's characters that would interfere
with bash processing are already escaped. However, it may be necessary to put
double quotes around it (like this: @code{\"$DATA\"}).
@item @code{$LANG}
The language identification string (it's defined by GenericLanguage).
@item @code{$VOICE}
The voice identification string (it's defined by AddVoice).
@item @code{$PITCH}
The desired pitch (a float number defined in GenericPitchAdd and GenericPitchMultiply).
@item @code{$RATE}
The desired rate or speed (a float number defined in GenericRateAdd and GenericRateMultiply)
@end itemize

Here is an example from @file{etc/speech-dispatcher/modules/epos-generic.conf}
@example
GenericExecuteSynth \
"epos-say -o --language $LANG --voice $VOICE --init_f $PITCH --init_t $RATE \
\"$DATA\" | sed -e s+unknown.*$++ >/tmp/epos-said.wav && play /tmp/epos-said.wav >/dev/null"
@end example
@end defvr

@defvr {GenericModuleConfiguration} AddVoice "@var{language}" "@var{symbolicname}" "@var{name}"
@xref{AddVoice}.
@end defvr

@defvr {GenericModuleConfiguration} GenericLanguage "iso-code" "string-subst"

Defines which string @code{string-subst} should be substituted for @code{$LANG}
given an @code{iso-code} language code.

Another example from Epos generic:
@example
GenericLanguage "en" "english"
GenericLanguage "cs" "czech"
GenericLanguage "sk" "slovak"
@end example
@end defvr

@defvr {GenericModuleConfiguration} GenericRateAdd @var{num}
@end defvr
@defvr {GenericModuleConfiguration} GenericRateMultiply @var{num}
@end defvr
@defvr {GenericModuleConfiguration} GenericPitchAdd @var{num}
@end defvr
@defvr {GenericModuleConfiguration} GenericPitchMultiply @var{num}
These parameters set rate and pitch conversion to compute
the value of @code{$RATE} and @code{$PITCH}. 

The resulting rate (or pitch) is calculated using the following formula:
@example
   (speechd_rate * GenericRateMultiply) + GenericRateAdd
@end example
where speechd_rate is a value between -100 (lowest) and +100 (highest)
Some meaningful conversion for the specific text-to-speech system
used must by defined.

(The values in GenericSthMultiply are multiplied by 100 because
DotConf currently doesn't support floats. So you can write 0.85 as 85 and
so on.)

Clients communicate with Speech Dispatcher via the Speech Synthesis

Internet Protocol documentation}.  The protocol is the actual
interface to Speech Dispatcher.

Usually you don't need to use SSIP directly.  You can use one of the supplied
libraries, which wrap the SSIP interface.  This is the
recommended way of communicating with Speech Dispatcher.  We try so support as
many programming environments as possible.  This manual (except SSIP) contains
documentation for the C and Python libraries, however there are also other
libraries developed as external projects.  Please contact us for information

@deffn {C API function} SPDConnection* spd_open(char* client_name, char* connection_name, char* user_name, SPDConnectionMode connection_mode)
@findex spd_open()

Opens a new connection to Speech Dispatcher and returns a socket file
descriptor you will use to communicate with Speech Dispatcher. The
socket file descriptor is a parameter used in all the other
functions. It reads Speech Dispatcher's port number from the
environment variable @var{SPEECHD_PORT}.

The three parameters @code{client_name}, @code{connection_name} and
@code{username} are there only for informational and navigational
purposes, they don't affect any settings or behavior of any
functions. The authentication mechanism has nothing to do with
@code{username}. These parameters are important for the user when he
wants to set some parameters for a given session, when he wants to
browse through history, etc. The parameter @code{connection_mode}
specifies how this connection should be handled internally and if
event notifications and index marking capabilities will be available.

@code{client_name} is the name of the client that opens the connection. Normally,
it should be the name of the executable, for example ``lynx'', ``emacs'', ``bash'',
or ``gcc''. It can be left as NULL.

@code{connection_name} determines the particular use of that connection. If you
use only one connection in your program, this should be set to ``main'' (passing
a NULL pointer has the same effect). If you use two or more connections in
your program, their @code{client_name}s should be the same, but @code{connection_name}s
should differ. For example: ``buffer'', ``command_line'', ``text'', ``menu''.

@code{username} should be set to the name of the user. Normally, you should
get this string from the system. If set to NULL, libspeechd will try to
determine it automatically by g_get_user_name().

@code{connection_mode} has two possible values: @code{SPD_MODE_SINGLE}
and @code{SPD_MODE_THREADED}. If the parameter is set to
@code{SPD_MODE_THREADED}, then @code{spd_open()} will open an
additional thread in your program which will handle asynchronous SSIP
replies and will allow you to use callbacks for event notifications
and index marking, allowing you to keep track of the progress
of speaking the messages. However, you must be aware that your
program is now multi-threaded and care must be taken when
using/handling signals. If @code{SPD_MODE_SINGLE} is chosen, the
library won't execute any additional threads and SSIP will run only as
a synchronous protocol, therefore event notifications and index
marking won't be available.

It returns a newly allocated SPDConnection* structure on success, or @code{NULL}
on error.

Each connection you open should be closed by spd_close() before the
end of the program, so that the associated connection descriptor is
closed, threads are terminated and memory is freed.

@end deffn

@deffn {C API function}  void spd_close(SPDConnection *connection)
@findex spd_close()

Closes a Speech Dispatcher socket connection, terminates associated
threads (if necessary) and frees the memory allocated by
spd_open(). You should close every connection before the end of your
program.

@code{connection} is the SPDConnection connection obtained by spd_open().

@subsection Speech Synthesis Commands

@defvar {C API type} SPDPriority
@vindex SPDPriority

@code{SPDPriority} is an enum type that represents the possible priorities that
can be assigned to a message.

@example
typedef enum@{
    SPD_IMPORTANT = 1,
    SPD_MESSAGE = 2,
    SPD_TEXT = 3,
    SPD_NOTIFICATION = 4,
    SPD_PROGRESS = 5

@xref{Top,,Message Priority Model,ssip, SSIP Documentation}.

@end defvar

@deffn {C API function}  int spd_say(SPDConnection* connection, SPDPriority priority, char* text);
@findex spd_say()

Sends a message to Speech Dispatcher. If this message isn't blocked by
some message of higher priority and this CONNECTION isn't paused, it
will be synthesized directly on one of the output devices. Otherwise,
the message will be discarded or delayed according to its priority.

@code{connection} is the SPDConnection* connection created by spd_open().

@code{priority} is the desired priority for this message. @xref{Top,,Message Priority Model,ssip, SSIP Documentation}.

@code{text} is a null terminated string containing text you want sent
to synthesis. It must be encoded in UTF-8. Note that this doesn't have
to be what you will finally hear. It can be affected by different
settings, such as spelling, punctuation, text substitution etc.

It returns a positive unique message identification number on success,
-1 otherwise.  This message identification number can be saved and
used for the purpose of event notification callbacks or history
handling.

@end deffn

@deffn {C API function}  int spd_sayf(SPDConnection* connection, SPDPriority priority, char* format, ...);
@findex spd_sayf()

Similar to @code{spd_say()}, simulates the behavior of printf().

@code{format} is a string containing text and formatting of the parameters, such as ``%d'',
``%s'' etc. It must be encoded in UTF-8.

@code{...} is an arbitrary number of arguments.

All other parameters are the same as for spd_say().

For example:
@example
       spd_sayf(conn, SPD_TEXT, "Hello %s, how are you?", username);
       spd_sayf(conn, SPD_IMPORTANT, "Fatal error on [%s:%d]", filename, line);
@end example

But be careful with unicode! For example this doesn't work:

@example
       spd_sayf(conn, SPD_NOTIFY, ``Pressed key is %c.'', key);
@end example

Why? Because you are supposing that key is a char, but that will
fail with languages using multibyte charsets. The proper solution
is:

@example
       spd_sayf(conn, SPD_NOTIFY, ``Pressed key is %s'', key);
@end example
where key is an encoded string.

It returns a positive unique message identification number on success, -1 otherwise.
This message identification number can be saved and used for the purpose of
event notification callbacks or history handling.

Pauses all messages received from the given connection. No messages
except for priority @code{notification} and @code{progress} are thrown
away, they are all waiting in a separate queue for resume(). Upon resume(), the
message that was being said at the moment pause() was received will be
continued from the place where it was paused.

It returns immediately. However, that doesn't mean that the speech
output will stop immediately. Instead, it can continue speaking
the message for a while until a place where the position in the text
can be determined exactly is reached. This is necessary to be able to
provide `resume' without gaps and overlapping.

When pause is on for the given client, all newly received
messages are also queued and waiting for resume().

@node Event Notification and Index Marking in C, History Commands in C, Information Retrieval Commands in C, C API
@subsection Event Notification and Index Marking in C

When the SSIP connection is run in asynchronous mode, it is possible
to register callbacks for all the SSIP event notifications and index
mark notifications, as defined in @ref{Message Event Notification
and Index Marking,,, ssip, SSIP Documentation}

@defvar {C API type} SPDNotification
@vindex SPDNotification
@anchor{SPDNotification}

@code{SPDNotification} is an enum type that represents the possible
base notification types that can be assigned to a message.

@example
typedef enum@{
    SPD_BEGIN = 1,
    SPD_END = 2,
    SPD_INDEX_MARKS = 4,
    SPD_CANCEL = 8,
    SPD_PAUSE = 16,
    SPD_RESUME = 32
@}SPDNotification;
@end example
@end defvar

There are currently two types of callbacks in the C API.

@defvar {C API type} SPDCallback
@vindex SPDCallback
@anchor{SPDCallback}
@code{void (*SPDCallback)(size_t msg_id, size_t client_id, SPDNotificationType state);}

This one is used for notifications about the events: @code{BEGIN}, @code{END}, @code{PAUSE}
and @code{RESUME}. When the callback is called, it provides three parameters for the event.

@code{msg_id} unique identification number of the message the notification is about.

@code{client_id} specifies the unique identification number of the client who sent the
message. This is usually the same connection as the connection which registered this
callback, and therefore uninteresting. However, in some special cases it might be useful
to register this callback for other SSIP connections, or register the same callback for
several connections originating from the same application.

@code{state} is the @code{SPD_Notification} type of this notification. @xref{SPDNotification}.
@end defvar

@defvar {C API type} SPDCallbackIM
@vindex SPDCallbackIM
@code{void (*SPDCallbackIM)(size_t msg_id, size_t client_id, SPDNotificationType state,
char *index_mark);}

@code{SPDCallbackIM} is used for notifications about index marks that have been reached
in the message.  (A way to specify index marks is e.g. through the SSML element
<mark/> in ssml mode.)

The syntax and meaning of these parameters are the same as for @ref{SPDCallback}
except for the additional parameter @code{index_mark}.

@code{index_mark} is a NULL terminated string associated with the index mark. Please
note that this string is specified by client application and therefore it needn't be
unique.
@end defvar

One or more callbacks can be supplied for a given @code{SPDConnection*} connection by
assigning the values of pointers to the appropriate functions to the following connection
members:

@example
    SPDCallback callback_begin;
    SPDCallback callback_end;
    SPDCallback callback_cancel;
    SPDCallback callback_pause;
    SPDCallback callback_resume;
    SPDCallbackIM callback_im;
@end example

There are three settings commands which will turn notifications on and
off for the current SSIP connection and cause the callbacks to be called
when the event is registered by Speech Dispatcher.

@deffn {C API function} int spd_set_notification_on(SPDConnection* connection, SPDNotification notification);
@findex spd_set_notification_on
@end deffn
@deffn {C API function} int spd_set_notification_off(SPDConnection* connection, SPDNotification notification);
@findex spd_set_notification_off
@end deffn
@deffn {C API function} int spd_set_notification(SPDConnection* connection, SPDNotification notification, const char* state);
@findex spd_set_notification

These functions will set the notification specified by the parameter
@code{notification} on or off (or to the given value)
respectively. Note that it is only safe to call these functions after
the appropriate callback functions have been set in the @code{SPDCallback}
structure. Doing otherwise is not considered an error, but the
application might miss some events due to callback functions not being
executed (e.g. the client might receive an @code{END} event without
receiving the corresponding @code{BEGIN} event in advance.

@code{connection} is the SPDConnection* connection created by spd_open().

@code{notification} is the requested type of notifications that should be reported by SSIP. @xref{SPDNotification}.
Note that also '|' combinations are possible, as illustrated in the example below.

@code{state} must be either the string ``on'' or ``off'', for switching the given notification on or off.

@end deffn

The following example shows how to use callbacks for the simple
purpose of playing a message and waiting until its end. (Please note
that checks of return values in this example as well as other code
not directly related to index marking, have been removed for the purpose
of clarity.)

@example
#include <semaphore.h>

sem_t semaphore;

/* Callback for Speech Dispatcher notifications */
void end_of_speech(size_t msg_id, size_t client_id, SPDNotificationType type)
@{
   /* We don't check msg_id here since we will only send one
       message. */

   /* Callbacks are running in a separate thread, so let the
       (sleeping) main thread know about the event and wake it up. */
   sem_post(&semaphore);
@}

int
main(int argc, char **argv)
@{
   SPDConnection *conn;

   sem_init(&semaphore, 0, 0);

   /* Open Speech Dispatcher connection in THREADED mode. */ 
   conn = spd_open("say","main", NULL, SPD_MODE_THREADED);

   /* Set callback handler for 'end' and 'cancel' events. */ 
   conn->callback_end = con->callback_cancel = end_of_speech;

   /* Ask Speech Dispatcher to notify us about these events. */ 
   spd_set_notification_on(conn, SPD_END);
   spd_set_notification_on(conn, SPD_CANCEL);

   /* Say our message. */
   spd_sayf(conn, SPD_MESSAGE, (char*) argv[1]);

   /* Wait for 'end' or 'cancel' of the sent message. 
      By SSIP specifications, we are guaranteed to get
      one of these two eventually. */ 
   sem_wait(&semaphore);

   return 0;

@subsection Direct SSIP Communication in C

It might happen that you want to use some SSIP function that is not
available through a library or you may want to use an available
function in a different manner. (If you think there is something
missing in a library or you have some useful comment on the
available functions, please let us know.) For this purpose, there are
a few functions that will allow you to send arbitrary SSIP commands on
your connection and read the replies.

@deffn {C API function} int spd_execute_command(SPDConnection* connection, char *command);
@findex spd_execute_command()

You can send an arbitrary SSIP command specified in the parameter @code{command}.

If the command is successful, the function returns a 0. If there is no such
command or the command failed for some reason, it returns -1.

@code{connection} is the SPDConnection* connection created by spd_open().

@code{command} is a null terminated string containing a full SSIP command
without the terminating sequence @code{\r\n}.

For example:
@example
        spd_execute_command(fd, "SET SELF RATE 60");
        spd_execute_command(fd, "SOUND_ICON bell");
@end example 

It's not possible to use this function for compound commands like @code{SPEAK}
where you are receiving more than one reply. If this is your case, please
see `spd_send_data()'.
@end deffn

@deffn {C API function} char* spd_send_data(SPDConnection* connection, const char *message, int wfr);
@findex spd_send_data()

You can send an arbitrary SSIP string specified in the parameter @code{message}
and, if specified, wait for the reply. The string can be any SSIP command, but
it can also be textual data or a command parameter.

If @code{wfr} (wait for reply) is set to SPD_WAIT_REPLY, you will receive the reply string
as the return value. If wfr is set to SPD_NO_REPLY, the return value is a NULL pointer.
If wfr is set to SPD_WAIT_REPLY, you should always free the returned string.

@code{connection} is the SPDConnection* connection created by spd_open().

@code{message} is a null terminated string containing a full SSIP
string.  If this is a complete SSIP command, it must include the full
terminating sequence @code{\r\n}.

@code{wfr} is either SPD_WAIT_REPLY (integer value of 1) or SPD_NO_REPLY (0).
This specifies if you expect to get a reply on the sent data according to SSIP.
For example, if you are sending ordinary text inside a @code{SPEAK} command,
you don't expect to get a reply, but you expect a reply after sending the final
sequence @code{\r\n.\r\n}.

For example (simplified by not checking and freeing the returned strings):
@example
        spd_send_data(conn, "SPEAK", SPD_WAIT_REPLY);
        spd_send_data(conn, "Hello world!\n", SPD_NO_REPLY);
        spd_send_data(conn, "How are you today?!", SPD_NO_REPLY);
        spd_send_data(conn, "\r\n.\r\n.", SPD_WAIT_REPLY);
@end example 

@end deffn


@node Python API, Guile API, C API, Client Programming
@section Python API

There is a full Python API available in @file{src/python/speechd/} in
the source tree.  Please see the Python docstrings for full reference
about the available objects and methods.

Simple Python client:
@example
import speechd
client = speechd.SSIPClient('test')
client.set_output_module('festival')
client.set_language('en')
client.set_punctuation(speechd.PunctuationMode.SOME)
client.speak("Hello World!")
client.close()
@end example 

The Python API respects the environment variables @var{SPEECHD_HOST}
and @var{SPEECHD_PORT} if host/port is not specified explicitly (see
@code{SSIPClient} constructor arguments).

Implementation of callbacks within the Python API tries to hide the
low level details of SSIP callback handling and provide a convenient
Pythonic interface.  You just pass a callable object (function) to the
@code{speak()} method and this function will be called whenever an
event occurs for the corresponding message.

Callback example:
@example
import speechd, time
called = []
client = speechd.SSIPClient('callback-test')
client.speak("Hi!", callback=lambda cb_type: called.append(cb_type))
time.sleep(2) # Wait for the events to happen.
print "Called callbacks:", called
client.close()
@end example 

Real-world callback functions will most often need some sort of
context information to be able to distinguish for which message the
callback was called.  This can be simply done in Python.  The
following example uses the actual message text as the context
information within the callback function.

Callback context example:
@example
import speechd, time

class CallbackExample(object):
    def __init__(self):
        self._client = speechd.SSIPClient('callback-test')

    def speak(self, text):
        def callback(callback_type):
            if callback_type == speechd.CallbackType.BEGIN:
                print "Speech started:", text
            elif callback_type == speechd.CallbackType.END:
                print "Speech completed:", text
            elif callback_type == speechd.CallbackType.CANCEL:
                print "Speech interupted:", text
        self._client.speak(text, callback=callback,
                           event_types=(speechd.CallbackType.BEGIN,
                                        speechd.CallbackType.CANCEL,
                                        speechd.CallbackType.END))

    def go(self):
        self.speak("Hi!")
        self.speak("How are you?")
        time.sleep(4) # Wait for the events to happen.
        self._client.close()
        
CallbackExample().go()
@end example 

@emph{Important notice:} The callback is called in Speech Dispatcher
listener thread.  No subsequent Speech Dispatcher interaction is
allowed from within the callback invocation.  If you need to do
something more complicated, do it in another thread to prevent
deadlocks in SSIP communication.

@node Server Core, Output Modules, Server Programming, Server Programming
@section Server Core

The main documentation for the server core is the code itself. This section
is only a general introduction intended to give you some basic information
and hints where to look for things. If you are going to make some modifications
in the server core, we will be happy if you get in touch with us on
@email{speechd@@lists.freebsoft.org}.

The server core is composed of two main parts, each of them implemented
in a separate thread. The @emph{server part} handles the communication
with clients and, with the desired configuration options, stores the messages
in the priority queue. The @emph{speaking part} takes care of
communicating with the output modules, pulls messages out of the priority
queue at the correct time and sends them to the appropriate synthesizer.

Synchronization between these two parts is done by thread mutexes.
Additionally, synchronization of the speaking part from both sides
(server part, output modules) is done via a SYSV/IPC semaphore.

@subheading Server part

After switching to the daemon mode (if required), it reads configuration
files and initializes the speaking part. Then it opens the socket
and waits for incoming data. This is implemented mainly in
@file{src/server/speechd.c} and @file{src/server/server.c}.

There are three types of events: new client connects to speechd,
old client disconnects, or a client sends some data. In the third
case, the data is passed to the @code{parse()} function defined
in @file{src/server/parse.c}.

If the incoming data is a new message, it's stored in a
queue according to its priority. If it is SSIP
commands, it's handled by the appropriate handlers.
Handling of the @code{SET} family of commands can be found
in @file{src/server/set.c} and @code{HISTORY} commands are
processed in @file{src/server/history.c}.

All reply messages of SSIP are defined in @file{src/server/msg.h}.

@subheading Speaking part

This thread, the function @code{speak()} defined in
@file{src/server/speaking.c}, is created from the server part process
shortly after initialization. Then it enters an infinite loop and
waits on a SYSV/IPC semaphore until one of the following actions
happen:

@itemize
@item
The server adds a new message to the queue of messages waiting
to be said.
@item
The currently active output module signals that the message
that was being spoken is done.
@item
Pause or resume is requested.
@end itemize

After handling the rest of the priority interaction (like actions
needed to repeat the last priority progress message) it decides
which action should be performed. Usually it's picking up
a message from the queue and sending it to the desired output
module (synthesizer), but sometimes it's handling the pause
or resume requests, and sometimes it's doing nothing.

As said before, this is the part of Speech Dispatcher that
talks to the output modules. It does so by using the output
interface defined in @file{src/server/output.c}.

@node Basic Structure, Communication Protocol for Output Modules, Output Modules, Output Modules
@subsection Basic Structure

Speech Dispatcher output modules are independent applications that,
using a simple common communication protocol, read commands from
standard input and then output replies on standard output,
communicating the requests to the particular software or hardware
synthesizer. Everything the output module writes on standard output
or reads from standard input should conform to the specifications
of the communication protocol. Additionally, standard error output
is used for logging of the modules.

Output module binaries are usually located in
@file{bin/speechd-modules/} and are loaded automatically when Speech
Dispatcher starts, according to configuration.  Their standard
input/output/error output is redirected to a pipe to Speech Dispatcher
and this way both sides can communicate.

When the modules start, they are passed the name of a configuration file
that should be used for this particular output module. 

Each output module is started by Speech Dispatcher as:

@example
my_module "configfile"
@end example

where @code{configfile} is the full path to the desired configuration
file that the output module should parse.

@node Communication Protocol for Output Modules, How to Write New Output Module, Basic Structure, Output Modules
@subsection Communication Protocol for Output Modules

The protocol by which the output modules communicate on standard
input/output is based on @ref{Top,,SSIP,ssip, SSIP
Documentation}, although it is highly simplified and a little bit
modified for the different purpose here. Another difference
is that event notification is obligatory in modules communication,
while in SSIP, this is an optional feature. This is because Speech
Dispatcher has to know all the events happening in the output modules
for the purpose of synchronization of various messages.

Since it's very similar to SSIP, @ref{Top,,General Rules,ssip, SSIP
Documentation}, for a general description of what the protocol looks
like. One of the exceptions is that since the output modules
communicate on standard input/output, we use only @code{LF} as the
line separator.

The return values are:
@itemize

@table @code
@item SPEAK
Start receiving a text message in the SSML format and synthesize it.
After sending a reply to the command, output module waits for the text
of the message.  The text can spread over any number of lines and is
finished by an end of line marker followed by the line containing the
single character @code{.} (dot).  Thus the complete character sequence
closing the input text is @code{LF . LF}.  If any line within the sent
text contains only a dot, an extra dot should be prepended before it.

During reception of the text message, output module doesn't send a
response to the particular lines sent.  The response line is sent only
immediately after the @code{SPEAK} command and after receiving the
closing dot line. This doesn't provide any means of synchronization,
instead, event notification is used for this purpose.

There is no explicit upper limit on the size of the text.

If the @code{SPEAK} command is received while the output module
is already speaking, it is considered an error.

Example:
@example
SPEAK
202 OK SEND DATA
<speak>
Hello, GNU!
</speak>
.
200 OK SPEAKING
@end example

After receiving the full text (or the first part of it), the output
module is supposed to start synthesizing it and take care of
delivering it to an audio device. When (or just before) the first
synthesized samples are delivered to the audio and start playing, the
output module must send the @code{BEGIN} event over the communication
socket to Speech Dispatcher, @xref{Events notification and index
marking}. After the audio stops playing, the event @code{STOP},
@code{PAUSE} or @code{END} must be delivered to Speech
Dispatcher. Additionally, if supported by the given synthesizer, the
output module can issue events associated with the included SSML index
marks when they are reached in the audio output.

@item CHAR
Synthesize a character. If the synthesizer supports a different behavior
for the event of ``character'', this should be used.

It works like the command @code{SPEAK} above, except that the argument
has to be exactly one line long. It contains the UTF-8 form of exactly
one character.

@item KEY
Synthesize a key name. If the synthesizer supports a different behavior
for the event of ``key name'', this should be used.

It works like the command @code{SPEAK} above, except that the argument
has to be exactly one line long. @xref{Top, ,SSIP KEY,ssip, SSIP
Documentation}, for the description of the allowed arguments.

@item SOUND_ICON
Produce a sound icon. According to the configuration of the particular
synthesizer, this can produce either a sound (e.g. .wav) or synthesize
some text.

It works like the command @code{SPEAK} above, except that the argument
has to be exactly one line long. It contains the symbolic name of the
icon that should be said. @xref{Top,,SSIP SOUND_ICON, ssip, SSIP
Documentation}, for more detailed description of the sound icons
mechanism.

@item STOP
Immediately stop speaking on the output device and cancel synthesizing
the current message so that the output module is prepared to receive a
new message. If there is currently no message being synthesized, it is
not considered an error to call @code{STOP} anyway.

This command is asynchronous. The output module is not supposed to
send any reply (not even error reply).

It should return immediately, although stopping the synthesizer may
require a little bit more time. The module must issue one of the events
@code{STOPPED} or @code{END} when the module is finally
stopped. @code{END} is issued when the playing stopped by itself
before the module could terminate it or if the architecture of the
output module doesn't allow it to decide, otherwise @code{STOPPED}
should be used.

@example
STOP
@end example

@item PAUSE
Stop speaking the current message at a place where we can exactly
determine the position (preferably after a @code{__spd_} index mark).  This
doesn't have to be immediate and can be delayed even for a few
seconds. (Knowing the position exactly is important so that we can
later continue the message without gaps or overlapping.) It doesn't do
anything else (like storing the message etc.).

This command is asynchronous. The output module is not supposed to
send any reply (not even error reply).

For example:
@example
PAUSE
@end example

@item SET
Set one of several speech parameters for the future messages.

Each of the parameters is written on a single line in the form
@example
name=value
@end example
where @code{value} can be either a number or a string, depending upon
the name of the parameter.

The @code{SET} environment is terminated by a dot on a single line.
Thus the complete character sequence closing the input text is
@code{LF . LF}

During reception of the settings, output module doesn't send any
response to the particular lines sent.  The response line is sent only
immediately after the @code{SET} command and after receiving the
closing dot line.

The available parameters that accept numerical values are @code{rate}
and @code{pitch}.

The available parameters that accept string values are
@code{punctuation_mode}, @code{spelling_mode}, @code{cap_let_recogn},
@code{voice}, and @code{language}.  The arguments are the same as for the
corresponding SSIP commands, except that they are written with small
letters. @xref{Top,,Parameter Setting Commands,ssip, SSIP
Documentation}.  The conversion between these string values and the
corresponding C enum variables can be easily done using
@file{intl/fdsetconv.c}.

Not all of these parameters must be set and the value of the string
arguments can also be @code{NULL}. If some of the parameters aren't
set, the output module should use its default.

It's not necessary to set these parameters on the synthesizer right
away, instead, it can be postponed until some message to be spoken arrives.

Here is an example:
@example
SET
203 OK RECEIVING SETTINGS
rate=20
pitch=-10
punctuation_mode=all
spelling_mode=on
punctuation_some=NULL
.
203 OK SETTINGS RECEIVED
@end example

@item QUIT
Terminates the output module. It should send the response, deallocate
all the resources, close all descriptors, terminate all child
processes etc. Then the output module should exit itself.

@example
QUIT
210 OK QUIT
@end example
@end table

@subsubsection Events notification and index marking
@anchor{Events notification and index marking}

Each output module must take care of sending asynchronous
notifications whenever the synthesizer (or the module) starts or stops
output audio on the speakers. Additionally, whenever possible, the
output module should report back to Speech Dispatcher index marks
found in the incoming SSML text whenever they are reached while
speaking. See SSML specifications for more details about the
@code{mark} element

Event and index mark notifications are reported by simply writing them
to the standard output. An event notification must never get in between
synchronous commands (those which require a reply) and their reply.


@table @code

@item BEGIN

This event must be issued whenever the module starts to speak the
given message. If this is not possible, it can issue it when it
starts to synthesize the message or when it receives the message.

It is prepended by the code @code{701} and takes the form

@example
701 BEGIN
@end example

@item END

This event must be issued whenever the module terminates speaking the
given message because it reached its end. If this is not possible, it
can issue this event when it is ready to receive a new message after
speaking the previous message.

Each @code{END} must always be preceeded (possibly not directly) by a
@code{BEGIN}.

It is prepended by the code @code{702} and takes the form

@example
702 END
@end example

@item STOP

This event should be issued whenever the module terminates speaking
the given message without reaching its end (as a consequence of
receiving the STOP command or because of some error) not because of
a @code{PAUSE} command. When the synthesizer in use doesn't allow
the module to decide, the event @code{END} can be used instead.

Each @code{STOP} must always be preceeded (possibly not directly) by a
@code{BEGIN}.

It is prepended by the code @code{703} and takes the form

@example
703 STOP
@end example

@item PAUSE

This event should be issued whenever the module terminates speaking
the given message without reaching its end because of receiving the
@code{PAUSE} command.

Each @code{PAUSE} must always be preceeded (possibly not directly) by a
@code{BEGIN}.

It is prepended by the code @code{704} and takes the form

@example
704 PAUSE
@end example

@item INDEX MARK

This event should be issued by the output module (if supported)
whenever an index mark (SSML tag @code{<mark/>}) is passed while speaking
a message. It is preceeded by the code @code{700} and takes the form

@example
700-name
700 INDEX MARK
@end example

where @code{name} is the value of the SSML attribute @code{name} in
the tag @code{<mark/>}.

@node How to Write New Output Module, The Skeleton of an Output Module, Communication Protocol for Output Modules, Output Modules
@subsection How to Write New Output Module

If you want to write your own output module, there are basically two
ways to do it. Either you can program it all yourself, which is fine
as long as you stick to the definition of an output module and its
communication protocol, or you can use our @file{module_*.c} tools.
If you use these tools, you will only have to write the core functions
like module_speak() and module_stop etc. and you will not have to
worry about the communication protocol and other formal things that
are common for all modules. Here is how you can do it using the
provided tools.

We will recommend here a basic structure of the code for an output
module you should follow, although it's perfectly ok to establish your
own if you have reasons to do so, if all the necessary functions and
data are defined somewhere in the file. For this purpose, we will use
examples from the output module for Flite (Festival Lite), so it's
recommended to keep looking at @code{flite.c} for reference.

A few rules you should respect:
@itemize
@item
The @file{module_*.c} files should be included at the specified place and
in the specified order, because they include directly some pieces of the
code and won't work in other places.
@item
If one or more new threads are used in the output module, they must block all signals.
@item
On module_close(), all lateral threads and processes should be terminated,
all memory freed. Don't assume module_close() is always called before exit()
and the sources will be freed automatically.
@item
We will be happy if all the copyrights are assigned to Brailcom, o.p.s.
in order for us to be in a better legal position against possible intruders.
@end itemize

@node The Skeleton of an Output Module, Output Module Functions, How to Write New Output Module, Output Modules
@subsection The Skeleton of an Output Module 

Each output module should include @file{intl/fdset.h} where the
SPDMsgSettings structure is defined to be able to handle the different
speech synthesis settings.

@example
#include "fdset.h"
@end example

Additionally, it's also reccomended to include @file{module_utils.h}
which provides many tools to help writing output modules and make the
code simpler. If your plugin needs the audio tools (if you take
care of the output to the soundcard instead of the synthesizer),
you also have to include @file{spd_audio.h}

@example
#include "module_utils.h"
#include "spd_audio.c"
@end example

The definition of macros @code{MODULE_NAME} and @code{MODULE_VERSION}
should follow:

@example
#define MODULE_NAME     "flite"
#define MODULE_VERSION  "0.1"
@end example

If you want to use the @code{DBG(message)} macro from @file{module_utils.c}
to print out debugging messages, you should insert these two lines. (Please
don't use printf for debugging, this doesn't work with multiple processes!)
(You will later have to actually start debugging in @code{module_init()})

@example
DECLARE_DEBUG();
@end example

You don't have to define the prototypes of the core functions
like module_speak() and module_stop(), these are already
defined in @file{module_utils.h}

Optionally, if your output module requires some special configuration,
apart from defining voices and configuring debugging (they are handled
differently, see below), you can declare the requested option
here. It will expand into a dotconf callback and declaration of the
variable.

(You will later have to actually register these options for
Speech Dispatcher in @code{module_load()})

There are currently 4 types of possible configuration options:

@itemize
@item @code{MOD_OPTION_1_INT(name);   /* Set up `int name' */}
@item @code{MOD_OPTION_1_STR(name);   /* Set up `char* name' */}
@item @code{MOD_OPTION_2(name);       /* Set up `char *name[2]' */}
@item @code{MOD_OPTION_@{2,3@}_HT(name);  /* Set up a hash table */}
@end itemize

@xref{Output Modules Configuration}.

For example Flite uses 2 options:
@example
MOD_OPTION_1_INT(FliteMaxChunkLength);
MOD_OPTION_1_STR(FliteDelimiters);
@end example

Every output module is started in 2 phases: @emph{loading} and
@emph{initialization}.

The goal of loading is to initialize empty structures for storing
settings and declare the DotConf callbacks for parsing configuration
files. In the second phase, initialization, all the configuration has
been read and the output module can accomplish the rest (check if
the synthesizer works, set up threads etc.).

You should start with the definition of @code{module_load()}. 

@example
int
module_load(void)
@{
@end example

Then you should initialize the settings tables. These are defined in
@file{module_utils.h} and will be used to store the settings received
by the @code{SET} command.
@example
    INIT_SETTINGS_TABLES();
@end example 

Also, define the configuration callbacks for debugging if you use
the @code{DBG()} macro.

@example
    REGISTER_DEBUG();
@end example

Now you can finally register the options for the configuration file
parsing. Just use these macros:
@itemize
        @item MOD_OPTION_1_INT_REG(name, default);  /* for integer parameters */
        @item MOD_OPTION_1_STR_REG(name, default);  /* for string parameters */
        @item MOD_OPTION_MORE_REG(name);   /* for an array of strings */
        @item MOD_OPTION_HT_REG(name);     /* for hash tables */
@end itemize

Again, an example from Flite:
@example
    MOD_OPTION_1_INT_REG(FliteMaxChunkLength, 300);
    MOD_OPTION_1_STR_REG(FliteDelimiters, ".");
@end example

If you want to enable the mechanism for setting
voices through AddVoice, use this function (for
an example see @code{generic.c}):

Example from Festival:
@example
    module_register_settings_voices();
@end example

@xref{Output Modules Configuration}.

If everything went correctly, the function should return 0, otherwise -1.

@example
    return 0;
@}
@end example

The second phase of starting an output module is handled by:

@example
int
module_init(void)
@{
@end example

If you use the DBG() macro, you should init debugging on the start
of this function. From that moment on, you can use DBG(). Apart from that,
the body of this function is entirely up to you. You should do all the
necessary initialization of the particular synthesizer.  All declared
configuration variables and configuration hash tables, together with
the definition of voices, are filled with their values (either default
or read from configuration), so you can use them already.

@example
   INIT_DEBUG();
   DBG("FliteMaxChunkLength = %d\n", FliteMaxChunkLength);
   DBG("FliteDelimiters = %s\n", FliteDelimiters);
@end example

This function should return 0 if the module was initialized
successfully, or -1 if some failure was encountered. In this case, you
should clean up everything, cancel threads, deallocate memory etc.; no
more functions of this output module will be touched (except for other
tries to load and initialize the module).

Example from Flite:

@example
    /* Init flite and register a new voice */
    flite_init();
    flite_voice = register_cmu_us_kal();

    if (flite_voice == NULL)@{
        DBG("Couldn't register the basic kal voice.\n");
        return -1;
    @}
    [...]
@end example

Now you have to define all the synthesis control functions
@code{module_speak}, @code{module_stop} etc.  See @ref{Output Module
Functions}. 

At the end, this simple include provides the main() function and all
the functionality related to being an output module of Speech
Dispatcher (parsing argv[] parameters, communicating on stdin/stdout,
...). It's recommended to study this file carefully and try to
understand what exactly it does, as it will be part of the source code
of your output module.

@example
#include "module_main.c"
@end example

If it doesn't work, it's most likely not your fault. Complain!  This
manual is not complete and the instructions in this sections aren't
either. Get in touch with us and together we can figure out what's
wrong, fix it and then warn others in this manual.

@node Output Module Functions, Module Utils Functions and Macros, The Skeleton of an Output Module, Output Modules
@subsection Output Module Functions

@deffn {Output Module Functions} int module_speak (char *data, size_t bytes, EMessageType msgtype)
@findex module_speak()

This is the function where the actual speech output is produced. It is
called every time Speech Dispatcher decides to send a message to
synthesis. The data of length @var{bytes} are passed in
a NULL terminated string @var{data}.  The argument @var{msgtype}
defines what type of message it is (different types should be handled
differently, if the synthesizer supports it).

Each output module should take care of setting the output device to
the parameters from msg_settings (defined in module_utils.h) (See
SPDMsgSettings in @file{intl/fdset.h}). However, it is not an error if
some of these values are ignored. At least rate, pitch and language
should be set correctly.

Speed and pitch are values between -100 and 100 included. 0 is the default
value that represents normal speech flow. So -100 is the slowest (or lowest)
and +100 is the fastest (or highest) speech.

The language parameter is given as a null-terminated string containing 
the name of the language according to RFC 1776 (en, cs, fr, ...). If the
requested language is not supported by this synthesizer, it's ok to abort
and return 0, because that's an error in user settings.

Other parameters are defined in @code{SPDMsgSettings} in @file{intl/fdset.h}.

An easy way to set the parameters is using the UPDATE_PARAMETER() and
UPDATE_STRING_PARAMETER() macros. @xref{Module Utils Functions and
Macros}.

Example from festival:
@example
    UPDATE_STRING_PARAMETER(language, festival_set_language);
    UPDATE_PARAMETER(voice, festival_set_voice);
    UPDATE_PARAMETER(rate, festival_set_rate);
    UPDATE_PARAMETER(pitch, festival_set_pitch);
    UPDATE_PARAMETER(punctuation_mode, festival_set_punctuation_mode);
    UPDATE_PARAMETER(cap_let_recogn, festival_set_cap_let_recogn);
@end example

This function should return 0 if it fails and 1 if the delivery
to the synthesizer is successful. It should return immediately,
because otherwise, it would block stopping, priority handling
and other important things in Speech Dispatcher.

If there is a need to stay longer, you should create a separate thread
or process. This is for example the case of some software synthesizers
which use a blocking function (eg. spd_audio_play) or hardware devices
that have to send data to output modules at some particular
speed. Note that if you use threads for this purpose, you have to set
them to ignore all signals. The simplest way to do this is to call
@code{set_speaking_thread_parameters()} which is defined in
module_utils.c.  Call it at the beginning of the thread code.
@end deffn

@deffn {Output module function}  {int module_stop} (void)
@findex module_stop()

This function should stop the synthesis of the currently spoken message
immediately and throw away the rest of the message.

This function should return immediately.  Speech Dispatcher will
not send another command until module_report_event_stop() is called.
Note that you cannot call module_report_event_stop() from within
the call to module_stop().  The best thing to do is emit
the stop event from another thread.

It should return 0 on success, -1 otherwise.
@end deffn

@deffn {Output module function}  {size_t module_pause} (void)
@findex module_pause()

This function should stop speaking on the synthesizer (or sending
data to soundcard) just after sending an @code{__spd_} index
mark so that Speech Dispatcher knows the position of stop.

The pause can wait for a short time until
an index mark is reached. However, if it's not possible to determine
the exact position, this function should have the same effect
as @code{module_stop}.

This function should return immediately.  Speech Dispatcher will
not send another command until module_report_event_pause() is called.
Note that you cannot call module_report_event_pause() from within
the call to module_pause().  The best thing to do is emit
the pause event from another thread.

For some software synthesizers, the desired effect can be archieved in this way:
When @code{module_speak()} is called, you execute a separate
process and pass it the requested message. This process
cuts the message into sentences and then runs in a loop
and sends the pieces to synthesis. If a signal arrives
from @code{module_pause()}, you set a flag and stop the loop
at the point where next piece of text would be synthesized.

It's not an error if this function is called when the device
is not speaking. In this case, it should return 0.

Note there is no module_resume() function.  The semantics of
@code{module_pause()} is the same as @code{module_stop()} except that
your module should stop after reaching a @code{__spd_} index mark.
Just like @code{module_stop()}, it should discard the rest of the
message after pausing.  On the next @code{module_speak()} call,
Speech Dispatcher will resend the rest of the message after the
index mark.

@subsubsection Initialization Macros and Functions

@deffn {Module Utils macro} INIT_SETTINGS_TABLES ()
@findex INIT_SETTINGS_TABLES
This macro initializes the settings tables where the parameters
received with the @code{SET} command are stored. You must call
this macro if you want to use the @code{UPDATE_PARAMETER()}
and @code{UPDATE_STRING_PARAMETER()} macros.

It is intended to be called from inside a function just
after the output module starts.
@end deffn

@subsubsection Debugging Macros
@deffn {Module Utils macro} DBG (format, ...)
@findex DBG
DBG() outputs a debugging message, if the @code{Debug} option in module's
configuration is set, to the file specified in configuration ad
@code{DebugFile}. The parameter syntax is the same as for the printf()
function. In fact, it calls printf() internally.
@end deffn

@deffn {Module Utils macro} FATAL (text)
@findex FATAL
Outputs a message specified as @code{text} and calls exit() with
the value EXIT_FAILURE. This terminates the whole output module
without trying to kill the child processes or freeing other
resources other than those that will be freed by the system.

It is intended to be used after some severe error has occurred.

@node Generic Macros and Functions, Functions used by module_main.c, Initialization Macros and Functions, Module Utils Functions and Macros
@subsubsection Generic Macros and Functions

@deffn {Module Utils macro} UPDATE_PARAMETER (param, setter)
@findex UPDATE_PARAMETER
Tests if the integer or enum parameter specified in @code{param}
(e.g. rate, pitch, cap_let_recogn, ...) changed since the
last time when the @code{setter} function was called.

If it changed, it calls the function @code{setter} with the
new value. (The new value is stored in the msg_settings
structure that is created by module_utils.h, which
you normally don't have to care about.)

The function @code{setter} should be defined as:
@example
void setter_name(type value);
@end example

Please look at the @code{SET} command in the communication protocol
for the list of all available parameters. 
@pxref{Communication Protocol for Output Modules}.

An example from Festival output module:

    [...]
}
@end verbatim

@end deffn

@deffn {Module Utils function} char* do_set()
@findex do_set
Takes care of communication after the @code{SET} command was
received. Doesn't call any particular function of the output module,
only sets the values in the settings tables. (You should then call the
@code{UPDATE_PARAMETER()} macro in module_speak() to actually set the
synthesizer to these values.)

It returns a response according to the communication protocol.
@end deffn

@deffn {Module Utils function} static int module_get_message_part ( const char* message, char* part, unsigned int *pos, size_t maxlen, const char* dividers)
@findex  module_get_message_part

Gets a part of the @code{message} according to the specified @code{dividers}.

It scans the text in @code{message} from the byte specified by
@code{*pos} and looks for one of the characters specified in
@code{dividers} followed by a whitespace character or the
terminating NULL byte. If one of them is encountered, the read text is
stored in @code{part} and the number of bytes read is
returned. If end of @code{message} is reached, the return value is
-1.

@code{message} is the text to process. It must be a NULL-terminated
uni-byte string.

@code{part} is a pointer to the place where the output text should
be stored. It must contain at least @code{maxlen} bytes of space.

@code{maxlen} is the maximum number of bytes that should be written
to @code{part}.

@code{dividers} is a NULL-terminated uni-byte string containing
the punctuation characters where the message should be divided
into smaller parts (if they are followed by whitespace).

After returning, @code{pos} is the position
where the function terminated in processing @code{message}.
@end deffn

@deffn {Output module function} void module_report_index_mark(char *mark)
@findex module_report_index_mark
@end deffn
@deffn {Output module function} void module_report_event_*()
@findex module_report_event_*

The @code{module_report_} functions serve for reporting event
notifications and index marking events. You should use them whenever
you get an event from the synthesizer which is defined in the output
module communication protocol.

Note that you cannot call these functions from within a call
to module_speak(), module_stop(), or module_pause().  The best
way to do this is to emit the events from another thread.

@end deffn

@deffn {Output module function}  {int module_close(int status)} (void)
@findex module_close()

This function is called when Speech Dispatcher terminates.  The output
module should terminate all threads and processes, free all resources,
close all sockets etc.  Never assume this function is called only when
Speech Dispatcher terminates and exit(0) will do the work for you.  It's
perfectly ok for Speech Dispatcher to load, unload or reload output modules
in the middle of its run.

If the parameter @code{status} is non-zero, the process should
terminate with this error value.

This function never returns, instead, it should call exit() to terminate
the whole process.

@subsubsection Multi-process output modules

@deffn {Module Utils function} void module_speak_thread_wfork (sem_t *semaphore,pid_t *process_pid, TChildFunction child_function, TParentFunction parent_function, int *speaking_flag, char **message, const size_t maxlen, const char *dividers, size_t *module_position, int *pause_requested)
@findex module_speak_thread_wfork

This function waits on the specified @code{semaphore} for activity.
When the semaphore is on, it forks and creates pipes between the two
processes in both directions.

In the child, it starts the @code{child_function}. This function
is supposed to never return. If it returns, exit(0) is called
immediatelly.

In the parent, it starts the @code{parent_function} and passes the
parameters. It waits until the function returns and writes its return
value to the @code{*module_position}. It then cleans the process, logs
the return values of @code{waitpid()} using DBG, sets *speaking_flag
to 0 and calls module_signal_end().

It is intended to be run from a separate thread, because it doesn't
return and it would block the communication on stdin/stdout.

@code{semaphore} is the pthread-type semaphore on which requests
for @code{child_function()} to run will be posted.

@code{process_pid} is a pointer to an integer where the pid of the
newly started child process should be stored.

@code{child_function} is the function that should be called in the child.

@code{parent_function} is the function that should be called in the parent.

@code{speaking_flag} is a pointer to an integer where this function
will write a 0 after the parent function terminates. This would mean
that the synthesizer stopped speaking.

@code{message} is a pointer to a NULL-terminated string containing the message
that should be passed to the parent function for synthesis.

@code{maxlen} is the maximum number of bytes that should be transfered from
parent to child over the pipe.

@code{dividers} is a NULL-terminated string containing the punctuation characters
at which the parent function should divide the message into smaller pieces.

@code{module_position} is a pointer to an integer for the actual position
(according to index marks) where the speaking terminated, as returned by
the parent function, will be stored.

@code{pause_requested} is a pointer to an integer flag, which is either 0 if
no pause request is pending, or 1 if the parent function should terminate
at a convenient place in the message because a pause is requested.

The two types of functions @code{child_function} and @code{parent_function}
are:

@example
typedef void (*TChildFunction)(TModuleDoublePipe dpipe, const size_t maxlen);
typedef size_t (*TParentFunction)(TModuleDoublePipe dpipe, const char* message,
                             const size_t maxlen, const char* dividers,
                             int *pause_requested);
@end example

The parameters have the same meaning as stated above. Additionally
there is the @code{dpipe} parameter which contains the information
necessary for communicating through pipes between the parent and the
child and vice-versa. Each of these functions should initialize
the pipes at the beginning and then communicate through them. The
preferred functions to do that are listed below.

@example
typedef struct@{
    int pc[2];            /* Parent to child pipe */
    int cp[2];            /* Child to parent pipe */
@}TModuleDoublePipe;
@end example
@end deffn

@deffn {Module Utils function} size_t module_parent_wfork ( TModuleDoublePipe dpipe, const char* message, const size_t maxlen, const char* dividers, int *pause_requested)
@findex module_parent_wfork

This is a generic function that can be used as the @code{parent_function()}
for @code{module_speak_thread_wfork}. It simply sends the data to the
child in smaller pieces and waits for confirmation with a single
@code{C} character on the pipe from child to parent.

In the beginning, it initializes the pipes and then it enters a simple cycle:
@enumerate
@item
Reads a part of the message or an index mark using
@code{module_get_message_part()}.
@item
Looks if there isn't a pending request for pause and handles
it.
@item
Sends the current part of the message to the child
using @code{module_parent_dp_write()}.
@item
Waits until a single character @code{C} comes from the other pipe
using @code{module_parent_dp_read()}.
@item
Repeats the cycle or terminates, if there is no more data.
@end enumerate
@end deffn

@deffn {Module Utils function} int module_parent_wait_continue(TModuleDoublePipe dpipe)
@findex module_parent_wait_continue
Waits until the character @code{C} (continue) is read from the pipe from child.
This function is intended to be run from the parent.

@code{dpipe} is the double pipe used for communication between the child and parent.

Returns 0 if the character was read or 1 if the pipe was broken before the
character could be read.
@end deffn

@deffn {Module Utils function} void module_parent_dp_init (TModuleDoublePipe dpipe)
@findex module_parent_dp_init
Initializes pipes (dpipe) in the parent. Currently it only closes the unnecessary ends.
@end deffn

@deffn {Module Utils function} void module_child_dp_close (TModuleDoublePipe dpipe)
@findex module_child_dp_init
Initializes pipes (dpipe) in the child. Currently it only closes the unnecessary ends.
@end deffn

@deffn {Module Utils function} void module_child_dp_write(TModuleDoublePipe dpipe,  const char *msg, size_t bytes)
@findex module_child_dp_write
Writes the specified number of @code{bytes} from @code{msg} to the pipe to the
parent. This function is intended, as the prefix says, to be run from the child.
Uses the pipes defined in @code{dpipe}.
@end deffn

@deffn {Module Utils function} void module_parent_dp_write(TModuleDoublePipe dpipe,  const char *msg, size_t bytes)
@findex module_parent_dp_write
Writes the specified number of @code{bytes} from @code{msg} into the pipe to the
child. This function is intended, as the prefix says, to be run from the parent.
Uses the pipes defined in @code{dpipe}.
@end deffn

@deffn {Module Utils function} int module_child_dp_read(TModuleDoublePipe dpipe  char *msg, size_t maxlen)
@findex module_child_dp_read
Reads up to @code{maxlen} bytes from the pipe from parent into the buffer @code{msg}.
This function is intended, as the prefix says, to be run from the child.
Uses the pipes defined in @code{dpipe}.
@end deffn

@deffn {Module Utils function} int module_parent_dp_read(TModuleDoublePipe dpipe,  char *msg, size_t maxlen)
@findex module_parent_dp_read
Reads up to @code{maxlen} bytes from the pipe from child into the buffer @code{msg}.
This function is intended, as the prefix says, to be run from the parent.
Uses the pipes defined in @code{dpipe}.
@end deffn

@deffn {Module Utils function} void module_sigblockall(void)
@findex module_sigblockall
Blocks all signals. This is intended to be run from the child processes
and threads so that their signal handling won't interfere with the
parent.
@end deffn

@deffn {Module Utils function} void module_sigunblockusr(sigset_t *some_signals)
@findex module_sigunblockusr
Use the set @code{some_signals} to unblock SIGUSR1.
@end deffn

@deffn {Module Utils function} void module_sigblockusr(sigset_t *some_signals)
@findex module_sigblockusr
Use the set @code{some_signals} to block SIGUSR1.
@end deffn

@subsubsection Memory Handling Functions

@deffn {Module Utils function} static void* xmalloc (size_t size)
@findex xmalloc
The same as the classical @code{malloc()} except that it executes
@code{FATAL(``Not enough memory'')} on error.
@end deffn

@deffn {Module Utils function} static void* xrealloc (void *data, size_t size)
@findex xrealloc
The same as the classical @code{realloc()} except that it also accepts
@code{NULL} as @code{data}. In this case, it behaves as @code{xmalloc}.
@end deffn

@end deffn

@node Index Marks in Output Modules,  , Module Utils Functions and Macros, Output Modules
@subsection Index Marks in Output Modules

Output modules need to provide some kind of synchronization and they have to
give Speech Dispatcher back some information about what part of the message
is currently being said. On the other hand, output modules are not able to tell
the exact position in the text because various conversions and message processing take place
(sometimes punctuation and spelling substitution, the message needs to be
recoded from multibyte to unibyte coding etc.) before the text reaches
the synthesizer.

For this reason, Speech Dispatcher places so-called index marks in
the text it sends to its output modules. They have the form:

@example
<mark name="id"/>
@end example

@code{id} is the identifier associated with each index
mark. Within a @code{module_speak()} message, each identifer is unique.
It consists of the string @code{__spd_} and a counter number.  Numbers
begin from zero for each message.  For example, the fourth index mark
within a message looks like

@example
<mark name="__spd_id_3"/>
@end example

When an index mark is reached, its identifier should be stored
so that the output module is able to tell Speech Dispatcher the identifier
of the last index mark. Also, index marks are the best place to stop
when the module is requested to pause (although it's ok to stop at
some place close by and report the last index mark).

Notice that index marks are in SSML format using the @code{mark} tag.

@chapter Download

You can download Speech Dispatcher's latest release source code from
@uref{http://www.freebsoft.org/speechd}. There is also information
on how to set up anonymous access to our CVS.

However, you may prefer to download Speech Dispatcher in a binary
package for your system. We don't distribute such packages ourselves.
If you run Debian GNU/Linux, it should be in the central repository
under the name @code{speech-dispatcher} or @code{speechd}. If you run
an rpm-based distribution like RedHat, Mandrake or SuSE Linux, please
try to look at @uref{http://www.rpmfind.net/}.

If you want to contact us, please look at

@node Reporting Bugs, How You Can Help, Download and Contact, Top
@chapter Reporting Bugs

If you believe you found a bug in Speech Dispatcher, we will be very
grateful if you let us know about it. Please do it by email on the
address @email{speechd@@bugs.freebsoft.org}, but please don't send us
messages larger than half a megabyte unless we ask you.

To report a bug in a way that is useful for the developers is not
as easy as it may seem. Here are some hints that you should follow in
order to give us the best information so that we can find and fix
the bug easily.

First of all, please try to describe the problem as exactly as you
can. We prefer raw data over speculations about where the problem may
lie. Please try to explain in what situation the bug happens. Even
if it's a general bug that happens in many situations, please try to
describe at least one case in as much detail, as possible.

Also, please specify the versions of programs that you use when
the bug happens. This is not only Speech Dispatcher, but also
the client application you use (speechd-el, say, etc.) and
the synthesizer name and version.

If you can reproduce the bug, please send us the log file also.  This
is very useful, because otherwise, we may not be able to reproduce the
bug with our configuration and program versions that differ from
yours. Configuration must be set to logging priority at least 4, but
best 5, so that it's useful for debugging purposes. You can do so in
@file{etc/speech-dispatcher/speechd.conf} by modifying the variable
@code{LogLevel}. Also, you may want to modify the log destination with
variable @code{LogFile}. After modifying these options, please restart
Speech Dispatcher and repeat the situation in which the bug
happens. After it happened, please take the log and attach it to the
bug report, preferably compressed using @code{gzip}. But note, that
when logging with level 5, all the data that come from Speech Dispatcher
is also recorded, so make sure there is no sensitive information
when you are reproducing the bug. Please make sure you switch back
to priority 3 or lower logging, because priority 4 or 5 produces
really huge logs.

If you are a programmer and you find a bug that is reproducible in
SSIP, you can send us the sequence of SSIP commands that lead to the
bug (preferably from starting the connection). You can also try to
reproduce the bug in a simple test-script under
@file{speech-dispatcher/src/tests} in the source tree. Please check
@file{speech-dispatcher/src/tests/README} and see the other tests
scripts there for an example.

When the bug is a SEGMENTATION FAULT, a backtrace from gdb is also
valuable, but if you are not familiar with gdb, don't bother with
that, we may ask you to do it later.

Finally, you may also send us a guess of what you think
happens in Speech Dispatcher that causes the bug, but this is
usually not very helpful. If you are able to provide additional technical
information instead, please do so.

@node How You Can Help, Appendices, Reporting Bugs, Top
@chapter How You Can Help

If you want to contribute to the development of Speech Dispatcher,
we will be very happy if you do so. Please contact us on 
@email{users@@lists.freebsoft.org}.

Here is a short, definitively not exhaustive, list of how you can
help us and other users.

@itemize
@item
@emph{Donate money:} We are a non-profit organization and we can't work without
funding. Brailcom, o.p.s. created Speech Dispatcher, speechd-el and also works
on other projects to help blind and visually impaired users of computers. We build
on Free Software and GNU/Linux, because we believe this is the right way. But it
won't be possible when we have no money. @uref{http://www.freebsoft.org/}

@item
@emph{Report bugs:} Every user, even if he can't give us money and he is not
a programmer, can help us very much by just using our software and telling
us about the bugs and inconveniences he encounters. A good user community that
reports bugs is a crucial part of development of a good Free Software package.
We can't test our software under all circumstances and on all platforms, so each
constructive bug report is highly appreciated. You can report bugs in Speech
Dispatcher on @email{speechd@@bugs.freebsoft.org}.

@item
@emph{Write or modify an application to support synthesis:} With
Speech Dispatcher, we have provided an interface that allows
applications easy access to speech synthesis. However powerful, it's
no more than an interface, and it's useless on its own. Now it's time
to write the particular client applications, or modify existing
applications so that they can support speech synthesis.  It is useful
if the application needs a specific interface for blind people or if
it wants to use speech synthesis for educational or other purposes.

@item
@emph{Develop new voices and language definitions for Festival:} In
the world of Free Software, currently Festival is the most promising
interface for Text-to-Speech processing and speech synthesis. It's
an extensible and highly configurable platform for developing synthetic
voices. If there is a lack of synthetic voices or no voices at all for
some language, we believe the wisest solution is to try to develop
a voice in Festival. It's certainly not advisable to develop your
own synthesizer if the goal is producing a quality voice system
in a reasonable time. Festival developers provide nice documentation
about how to develop a voice and a lot of tools that help doing
this. We found that some language definitions can be constructed
by canibalizing the already existing definitions and can be tuned
later. As for the voice samples, one can temporarily use the
MBROLA project voices. But please note that, although they are
downloadable for free (as price), they are not Free Software
and it would be wonderful if we could replace them by Free Software
alternatives as soon as possible.
See @uref{http://www.cstr.ed.ac.uk/projects/festival/}.

@item
@emph{Help us with this or other Free-b-Soft projects:} Please look at
@uref{http://www.freebsoft.org} to find information about our
projects. There is a plenty of work to be done for the blind and
visually impaired people to make their work with computers easier.

@item
@emph{Spread the word about Speech Dispatcher and Free Software:} You can
help us, and the whole community around Free Software, just by telling
your friends about the amazing world of Free Software. It doesn't
have to be just about Speech Dispatcher; you can tell them about
other projects or about Free Software in general. Remember that
Speech Dispatcher could only arise out of understanding of some people
of the principles and ideas behind Free Software. And this is mostly
the same for the rest of the Free Software world.
See @uref{http://www.gnu.org/} for more information about GNU/Linux
and Free Software.

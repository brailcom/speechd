@cindex Philosophy

Speech Dispatcher is a device independent layer for speech synthesis
that provides a common easy to use interface for both client
applications (programs that want to speak) and for software
synthesizers (programs actually able to convert text to speech).

High quality speech synthesis is now commonly available both as
propriatary and Free Software solutions. It has a wide field of
possible uses from educational software to specialized systems,
e.g. in hospitals or laboratories. It is also a key compensation tool
for the visually impaired users. For them, it is one of the two
possible ways of getting output from a computer (the second one being
a Braille display).

The various speech synthesizers are quite different, both in their
interfaces and capabilities. Thus a general common interface is needed
so that the client application programmers have an easy way to use
software speech synthesis and don't have to care about peculiar
details of the various synthesizers.

The absence of such a common and standardized interface and thus the
difficulty for programmers to use software speech synthesis has
been a major reason why the potential of speech synthesis technology
is still not fully expoited.

Ideally, there would be little distinction for applications whether
they output messages on the screen or via speech. Speech Dispatcher
can be compared to what a GUI toolkit is for the graphical
interface. Not only does it provide an easy to use interface, some
kind of theming and configuration mechanisms, but also it takes care
of some of the issues inherent with this particular mode of output,
such as the need for speech message serialization and interaction with
the audio subsystem.

@node Basic Design, Features Overview, Motivation, Introduction
@section Design
@cindex Design

@heading Current Design
The communication between all applications and synthesizers, when
implemented directly, is a mess. For this purpose, we wanted
Speech Dispatcher to be a layer separating applications and
synthesizers so that applications wouldn't have to care about
synthesizers and synthesizers wouldn't have to care about interaction
with applications.

We decided we would implement Speech Dispatcher as a server receiving
commands from applications over a protocol called @code{SSIP},
parsing them if needed, and calling the appropriate functions
of output modules communicating with the different synthesizers.
These output modules are implemented as plug-ins, so that the user
can just load a new module if he wants to use a new synthesizer.

Each client (application that wants to speak) opens a socket
connection to Speech Dispatcher and calls functions like say(),
stop(), and pause() provided by a library implementing the protocol.
This shared library is still on the client side and sends Speech
Dispatcher SSIP commands over the socket. When the messages arrive at
Speech Dispatcher, it parses them, reads the text that should be said
and puts it in one of several queues according to the priority of the
message and other criteria. It then decides when, with which
parameters (set up by the client and the user), and on which
synthesizer it will say the message. These requests are handled by the
output plug-ins (output modules) for different hardware and software
synthesizers and then said aloud.

@image{figures/architecture,155mm,,Speech Dispatcher architecture}

See also the detailed description @ref{Client Programming} interfaces, and
@ref{Server Programming} documentation.

@heading Future Design

Speech Dispatcher currently mixes two important features: common
low-level interface to multiple speech synthesizers and message
management (including priorities and history). This became even more
evident when we started thinking about handling messages intended for
output on braille devices.  Such messages of course need to be
synchronized with speech messages and there is little reason why the
accessibility tools should send the same message twice for these two
different kinds of output used by blind people (often simultaneously).
Outside the world of accessibility, applications also want to either
have full control over the sound (bypass prioritisation) or to only
retrieve the synthesized data, but not play them immediatelly.

We want to eventually split Speech Dispatcher into two independent
components: one providing a low-level interface to speech synthesis
drivers, which we now call TTS API Provider and is already largely
implemented in the Free(b)Soft project, and the second doing message
managemenet, called Message Dispatcher. This will allow Message
Dispatcher to also output on Braille as well as to use the TTS API
Provider separately.

From implementation point of view, an opportunity for new design based
on our previous experiences allowed us to remove several bottlenecks
for speed (responsiveness), ease of use and ease of implementation of
extensions (particularly output modules for new synthesizers). From
the architecture point of view and possibilities for new developments,
we are entirely convinced that both the new design in general and the
inner design of the new components is much better.

While a good API and its implementation for Braille are already
existent in the form of BrlAPI, the API for speech is now under
developement. Please see another architecture diagram showing how we
imagine Message Dispatcher in the future.

@cindex Synthesizers
@cindex Other programs

In this version, most of the features of Speech Dispatcher are
implemented and we believe it is now useful for applications as a
device independent Text-to-Speech layer and an accessibility message
coordination layer.

Currently, one of the most advanced applications that works with
Speech Dispatcher is @code{speechd-el}. This is a client for Emacs,
targeted primarily for blind people. It is similar to Emacspeak,
however the two take a bit different approach and serve different user
needs. You can find speechd-el on
@uref{http://www.freebsoft.org/speechd-el/}. speechd-el provides
speech output when using nearly any GNU/Linux text interface, like
editing text, reading email, browsing the web, etc.

Orca, the primary screen reader for the Gnome Desktop, supports Speech
Dispatcher directly since its version 2.19.0.  See
@uref{http://live.gnome.org/Orca/SpeechDispatcher} for more
information.

We also provide a shared C library, a Python library, a Java, Guile
and a Common Lisp libraries that implement the SSIP functions of
Speech Dispatcher in higher level interfaces. Writing client
applications in these languages should be quite easy.

On the synthesis side, there is good support for Festival, eSpeak,
Flite, Cicero, IBM TTS, MBROLA, Epos, Dectalk software, Cepstral Swift
and others. See @xref{Supported Modules}.

We decided not to interface the simple hardware speech devices as they
don't support synchronization and therefore cause serious problems
when handling multiple messages.  Also they are not extensible, they
are usually expensive and often hard to support. Today's computers are
fast enough to perform software speech synthesis and Festival is a
great example.

@node Installation, Running, User's Documentation, User's Documentation
@section Installation

This part only deals with the general aspects of installing
Speech Dispatcher. If you are compiling from source code (distribution
tarball or git), please refer to the file @file{INSTALL} in your
source tree.

@subsection The requirements

You will need these components to run Speech Dispatcher:
@itemize
@item glib 2.0  (@uref{http://www.gtk.org})
@item libdotconf 1.3 (@uref{http://github.com/williamh/dotconf})
@item pthreads
@end itemize

We recommend to also install these packages:
@itemize
 @item Festival (@uref{http://www.cstr.ed.ac.uk/projects/festival/})
 @item festival-freebsoft-utils 0.3+ (@uref{http://www.freebsoft.org/festival-freebsoft-utils})
 @item Sound icons library @* (@uref{http://www.freebsoft.org/pub/projects/sound-icons/sound-icons-0.1.tar.gz})
@end itemize

@subsection Recommended installation procedure

@itemize

@item Install your software synthesizer

Although we highly recommend to use Festival for its excellent
extensibility, good quality voices, good responsiveness and best
support in Speech Dispatcher, you might want to start with eSpeak, a
lightweight multi-lingual feature-complete synthesizer, to get all the
key components working and perhaps only then switch to
Festival. Installation of eSpeak should be easier and the default
configuration of Speech Dispatcher is set up for eSpeak for this
reason.

You can of course also start with Epos or any other supported synthesizer.

@item Make sure your synthesizer works

There is usually a way to test if the installation of your speech
synthesizer works. For eSpeak run @code{espeak "test"}, for Flite run
@code{flite -t "Hello!"} and hear the speech. For Festival run
@code{festival} and type in

@example
(SayText "Hello!")
(quit)
@end example

@item Install Speech Dispatcher

Install the packages for Speech Dispatcher from your distribution or
download the source tarball (or git) from
@url{http://www.freebsoft.org/speechd} and follow the instructions in
the file @code{INSTALL} in the source tree.

@item Configure Speech Dispatcher

You can skip this step in most cases. If you however want to setup
your own configuration of the Dispatchers default values, the easiest
way to do so is through the @code{spd-conf} configuration script. It
will guide you through the basic configuration. It will also
subsequently perform some diagnostics tests and offer some limited
help with troubleshooting. Just execute

@example
spd-conf
@end example

under an ordinary user or system user like 'speech-dispatcher'
depending on whether you like to setup Speech Dispatcher as user or
system service respectively. You might also want to explore the
offered options or run some of its subsystems manually, type
@code{spd-conf -h} for help.

If you do not want to use this script, it doesn't work in your case
or it doesn't provide enough configuration flexibility, please
continue as described below and/or in @xref{Running Under Ordinary Users}.

@item Test Speech Dispatcher

The simplest way to test Speech Dispatcher is through
@code{spd-conf -d} or through the @code{spd-say} tool.

Example:
@example
spd-conf -d
spd-say "Hello!"
spd-say -l cs -r 90 "Ahoj"
@end example

If you don't hear anything, please @xref{Troubleshooting}.

@end itemize

@subsection How to use eSpeak NG or eSpeak with MBROLA

Please follow the guidelines at
@url{https://github.com/espeak-ng/espeak-ng/blob/master/docs/mbrola.md}
(resp. @url{http://espeak.sourceforge.net/mbrola.html})
for installing eSpeak NG (resp. eSpeak) with a set of MBROLA voices that you
want to use.

Check the @file{modules/espeak-ng-mbrola-generic.conf}
(resp. @file{modules/espeak-mbrola-generic.conf}) configuration files for the
@code{AddVoice} lines. If a line for any of the voices you have installed
(and it is supported by your version of eSpeak NG (resp. eSpeak),
e.g. @code{ls /usr/share/espeak-ng-data/voices/mb/mb-*}
(resp. @code{ls /usr/share/espeak-data/voices/mb/mb-*}))
is not contained here, please add it. Check if @code{GenericExecuteString}
contains the correct name of your mbrola binary and correct path to its voice
database.

Restart speech-dispatcher and in your client, select
@code{espeak-ng-mbrola-generic} (resp. @code{espeak-mbrola-generic}) as your
output module, or test it with the following command

@example
spd-say -o espeak-ng-mbrola-generic -l cs Testing
@end example

(resp.
@example
spd-say -o espeak-mbrola-generic -l cs Testing
@end example
)

@node Running, Troubleshooting, Installation, User's Documentation
@section Running

Speech Dispatcher is normally executed on a per-user basis.  This
provides more flexibility in user configuration, access rights and is
essential in any environment where multiple people use the computer at
the same time. It used to be possible to run Speech Dispatcher as a system
service under a special user (and still is, with some limitations), but
this mode of execution is strongly discouraged.

@menu

* Setting Communication Method::
@end menu

@node Running Under Ordinary Users, Running in a Custom Setup, Running, Running
@subsection Running Under Ordinary Users

No special provisions need to be done to run Speech Dispatcher under
the current user. The Speech Dispatcher process will use (or create) a
@file{~/.cache/speech-dispatcher/} directory for its purposes (logging,
pidfile).

Optionally, a user can place his own configuration file in
@file{~/.config/speech-dispatcher/speechd.conf} and it will be
automatically loaded by Speech Dispatcher. The preferred way to do so
is via the @code{spd-conf} configuration command. If this user
configuration file is not found, Speech Dispatcher will simply use the
system wide configuration file (e.g. in
@file{/etc/speech-dispatcher/speechd.conf}).

@example
# speech-dispatcher
# spd-say test
@end example

@node Running in a Custom Setup, Setting Communication Method, Running Under Ordinary Users, Running
@subsection Running in a Custom Setup

Speech Dispatcher can be run in any other setup of executing users, port
numbers and system paths as well. The path to configuration, pidfile and
logfiles can be specified separately via compilation flags,
configuration file options or command line options in this ascending
order of their priority.

This way can also be used to start Speech Dispatcher as a system wide
service from /etc/init.d/ , although this approach is now discouraged.

@node Setting Communication Method,  , Running in a Custom Setup, Running
@subsection Setting Communication Method

Currently, two different methods are supported for communication
between the server and its clients.

For local communication, it's preferred to use @emph{Unix sockets},
where the communication takes place over a Unix socket with its
driving file located by default in the user's runtime directory as
@code{XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/speech-dispatcher/speechd.sock}. In this way, there can be no
conflict between different user sessions using different Speech
Dispatchers in the same system. By default, permissions are set in
such a way, that only the same user who started the server can access
it, and communication is hidden to all other users.

The other supported mechanism is @emph{Inet sockets}. The server will
thus run on a given port, which can be made accessible either localy
or to other machines on the network as well. This is very useful in a
network setup. Be however aware that while using Inet sockets, both
parties (server and clients) must first agree on the communication
port number to use, which can create a lot of confusion in a setup
where multiple instances of the server serve multiple different users.
Also, since there is currently no authentication mechanism, during
Inet socket communication, the server will make no distinction between
the different users connecting to it. The default port is 6560 as set
in the server configuration.

Client applications will respect the @emph{SPEECHD_ADDRESS} environment
variable.  The method ('@code{unix_socket}' or '@code{inet_socket}')
is optionally followed by it's parameters separated by a colon.
For an exact description, please  @xref{Address specification}.

An example of launching Speech Dispatcher using unix_sockets
for communication on a non-standard destination and subsequently
using spd-say to speak a message:

@example
killall -u `whoami` speech-dispatcher
speech-dispatcher -c unix_socket -S /tmp/my.sock
SPEECHD_ADDRESS=unix_socket:/tmp/my.sock spd-say "test"
@end example

@node Troubleshooting, Configuration, Running, User's Documentation
@section Troubleshooting

If you are experiencing problems when running Speech Dispatcher, please:

@itemize

@item
Use @code{spd-conf} to run diagnostics:

@example
spd-conf -d
@end example

@item
Check the appropriate logfile in
@file{~/.cache/speech-dispatcher/log/speech-dispatcher.log} for user Speech
Dispatcher or in @file{/var/log/speech-dispatcher/speech-dispatcher.log}. Look
for lines containing the string 'ERROR' and their surrounding
contents. If you hear no speech, restart Speech Dispatcher and look
near the end of the log file -- before any attempts for synthesis of
any message. Usually, if something goes wrong with the initialization
of the output modules, a textual description of the problem and a
suggested solution can be found in the log file.

@item
If this doesn't reveal the problem, please run
@example
spd-conf -D
@end example

Which will genereate a very detailed logfile archive
which you can examine yourself or send to us with
a request for help.

@item
You can also try to say some message directly through the utility
@code{spd-say}.

Example:
@example
        spd-say "Hello, does it work?"
        spd-say --language=cs --rate=20 "Everything ok?"
@end example

@item
Check if your configuration files (speechd.conf, modules/*.conf)
are correct (some uninstalled synthesizer specified as the default,
wrong values for default voice parameters etc.)

@item
There is a know problem in some versions of Festival. Please make sure
that Festival server_access_list configuration variable and your
/etc/hosts.conf are set properly. server_access_list must contain the
symbolic name of your machine and this name must be defined in
/etc/hosts.conf and point to your IP address. You can test if this is
set correctly by trying to connect to the port Festival server is
running on via an ordinary telnet (by default like this: @code{telnet
localhost 1314}). If you are not rejected, it works.

@subsection Configuration file syntax

We use the DotConf library to read a permanent text-file based
configuration, so the syntax might be familiar to many users.

Each of the string constants, if not otherwise stated differently,
should be encoded in UTF-8. The option names use only the
standard ASCII charset restricted to upper- and lowercase characters
(@code{a}, @code{b}), dashes (@code{-}) and underscores @code{_}.

Comments and temporarily inactive options begin with @code{#}.
If such an option should be turned on, just remove the comment
character and set it to the desired value.
@example
# this is a comment
# InactiveOption "this option is turned off"

@subsection Configuration options

All available options are documented directly in the file and examples
are provided.  Most of the options are set to their default value and
commented out.  If you want to change them, just change the value and
remove the comment symbol @code{#}.

@node Audio Output Configuration, Client Specific Configuration, Configuration options, Configuration
@subsection Audio Output Configuration

Audio output method (ALSA, Pulse etc.) can be configured centrally
from the main configuration file @code{speechd.conf}. The option
@code{AudioOutputMethod} selects the desired audio method and further
options labeled as @code{AudioALSA...} or @code{AudioPulse...} provide
a more detailed configuration of the given audio output method.

It is possible to use a list of preferred audio output methods,
in which case each output module attempts to use the first availble
in the given order.

The example below prefers Pulse Audio, but will use ALSA if unable
to connect to Pulse:
@example
 AudioOutputMethod "pulse,alsa"
@end example

Please note however that some more simple output modules or
synthesizers, like the generic output module, do not respect these
settings and use their own means of audio output which can't be
influenced this way. On the other hand, the fallback dummy output
module tries to use any available means of audio output to deliver its
error message.

@node Client Specific Configuration, Output Modules Configuration, Audio Output Configuration, Configuration
@subsection Client Specific Configuration

It is possible to automatically set different default values of speech
parameters (e.g.  rate, volume, punctuation, default voice...) for
different applications that connect to Speech Dispatcher. This is
especially useful for simple applications that have no parameter
setting capabilities themselves or they don't support a parameter
setting you wish to change (e.g. language).

Using the commands @code{BeginClient "IDENTIFICATION"} and
@code{EndClient} it is possible to open and close a section of
parameter settings that only affects those client applications that
identify themselves to Speech Dispatcher under the specific
identification code which is matched against the string
@code{IDENTIFICATION}.  It is possible to use wildcards ('*' matches
any number of characters and '?' matches exactly one character) in the
string @code{IDENTIFICATION}.

The identification code normally consists of 3 parts:
@code{user:application:connection}. @code{user} is the username of the
one who started the application, @code{application} is the name of the
application (usually the name of the binary for it) and
@code{connection} is a name for the connection (one application might
use more connections for different purposes).

An example is provided in @code{/etc/speech-dispatcher/speechd.conf}
(see the line @code{Include "clients/emacs.conf"} and
@code{/etc/speech-dispatcher/clients/emacs.conf}.

@node Output Modules Configuration, Log Levels, Client Specific Configuration, Configuration
@subsection Output Modules Configuration

Each user should turn on at least one output module in his
configuration, if he wants Speech Dispatcher to produce
any sound output. If no output module is loaded, Speech Dispatcher
will start, log messages into history and communicate with clients,
but no sound is produced.

Each output module has an
``AddModule'' line in
@file{speech-dispatcher/speechd.conf}. Additionally, each output
module can have its own configuration file.

The audio output is handled by the output modules themselves, so this
can be switched in their own configuration files under
@code{etc/speech-dispatcher/modules/}.

@subsubsection Loading Modules in speechd.conf

@anchor{AddModule}
Each module that should be run when Speech Dispatcher starts must be loaded

one binary module multiple times under different names with different
configurations. This is especially useful for loading the generic output
module. @xref{Configuration of the Generic Output Module}.

@example

@var{module_name} is the name of the output module.

@var{module_binary} is the name of the binary executable
of this output module. It can be either absolute or relative
to @file{bin/speechd-modules/}.

@var{module_config} is the file where the configuration for
this output module is stored. It can be either absolute or relative
to @file{etc/speech-dispatcher/modules/}. This parameter is optional.

@node Configuration files of output modules, Configuration of the Generic Output Module, Loading Modules in speechd.conf, Output Modules Configuration
@subsubsection Configuration Files of Output Modules

Each output module is different and therefore has different
configuration options. Please look at the comments in its
configuration file for a detailed description. However, there are
several options which are common for some output modules. Here is a
short overview of them.

@itemize
@item AddVoice "@var{language}" "@var{symbolicname}" "@var{name}"
@anchor{AddVoice}

Each output module provides some voices and sometimes it even supports
different languages. For this reason, there is a common mechanism for
specifying these in the configuration, although no module is
obligated to use it. Some synthesizers, e.g. Festival, support the
SSIP symbolic names directly, so the particular configuration of these
voices is done in the synthesizer itself.

For each voice, there is exactly one @code{AddVoice} line.

@var{language} is the ISO language code of the language of this voice, possibly
with a region qualification.

@var{symbolicname} is a symbolic name under which you wish this voice
to be available. See @ref{Top,,Standard Voices, ssip, SSIP
Documentation} for the list of names you can use.

@var{name} is a name specific for the given output module. Please see
the comments in the configuration file under the appropriate AddModule
section for more info.

For example our current definition of voices for Epos (file
@code{/etc/speech-dispatcher/modules/generic-epos.conf} looks like
this:

@example
        AddVoice        "cs"  "male1"   "kadlec"
        AddVoice        "sk"  "male1"   "bob"
@end example

@item ModuleDelimiters "@var{delimiters}", ModuleMaxChunkLength @var{length}

Normally, the output module doesn't try to synthesize all
incoming text at once, but instead it cuts it into smaller
chunks (sentences, parts of sentences) and then synthesizes
them one by one. This second approach, used by some output
modules, is much faster, however it limits the ability of
the output module to provide good intonation.

NOTE: The Festival module does not use ModuleDelimiters and
ModuleMaxChunkLength.

For this reason, you can configure at which characters
(@var{delimiters}) the text should be cut into smaller blocks
or after how many characters (@var{length}) it should be cut,
if there is no @var{delimiter} found.

Making the two rules more strict, you will get better speed
but give away some quality of intonation. So for example
for slower computers, we recommend to include comma (,)
in @var{delimiters} so that sentences are cut into phrases,
while for faster computers, it's preferable
not to include comma and synthesize the whole compound
sentence.

The same applies to @code{MaxChunkLength}, it's better
to set higher values for faster computers.

For example, curently the default for Flite is

@example
    FestivalMaxChunkLength  500
    FestivalDelimiters  ".?!;"
@end example

The output module may also decide to cut sentences on delimiters
only if they are followed by a space. This way for example
``file123.tmp'' would not be cut in two parts, but ``The horse
raced around the fence, that was lately painted green, fell.''
would be. (This is an interesting sentence, by the way.)

@node Configuration of the Generic Output Module,  , Configuration files of output modules, Output Modules Configuration
@subsubsection Configuration files of the Generic Output Module

The generic output module allows you to easily write your
own output module for synthesizers that have a simple
command line interface by modifying the configuration
file. This way, users can add support for their device even if they don't
know how to program. @xref{AddModule}.

The core part of a generic output module is the command
execution line.

@defvr {Generic Module Configuration} GenericExecuteSynth "@var{execution_string}"

@code{execution_string} is the command that should be executed
in a shell when it's desired to say something. In fact, it can
be multiple commands concatenated by the @code{&&} operator. To stop
saying the message, the output module will send a KILL signal to
the process group, so it's important that it immediately
stops speaking after the processes are killed. (On most GNU/Linux
system, the @code{play} utility has this property).

In the execution string, you can use the following variables,
which will be substituted by the desired values before executing
the command.

@itemize
@item @code{$DATA}
The text data that should be said. The string's characters that would interfere
with bash processing are already escaped. However, it may be necessary to put
double quotes around it (like this: @code{\"$DATA\"}).
@item @code{$LANG}
The language identification string (it's defined by GenericLanguage).
@item @code{$VOICE}
The voice identification string (it's defined by AddVoice).
@item @code{$PITCH}
The desired pitch (a float number defined in GenericPitchAdd and GenericPitchMultiply).
@item @code{$PITCH_RANGE}
The desired pitch range (a float number defined in GenericPitchRangeAdd and GenericPitchRangeMultiply).
@item @code{$RATE}
The desired rate or speed (a float number defined in GenericRateAdd and GenericRateMultiply)
@end itemize

Here is an example from @file{etc/speech-dispatcher/modules/epos-generic.conf}
@example
GenericExecuteSynth \
"epos-say -o --language $LANG --voice $VOICE --init_f $PITCH --init_t $RATE \
\"$DATA\" | sed -e s+unknown.*$++ >/tmp/epos-said.wav && play /tmp/epos-said.wav >/dev/null"
@end example
@end defvr

@defvr {GenericModuleConfiguration} AddVoice "@var{language}" "@var{symbolicname}" "@var{name}"
@xref{AddVoice}.
@end defvr

@defvr {GenericModuleConfiguration} GenericLanguage "iso-code" "string-subst"

Defines which string @code{string-subst} should be substituted for @code{$LANG}
given an @code{iso-code} language code.

Another example from Epos generic:
@example
GenericLanguage "en-US" "english-US"
GenericLanguage "cs" "czech"
GenericLanguage "sk" "slovak"
@end example
@end defvr

@defvr {GenericModuleConfiguration} GenericRateAdd @var{num}
@end defvr
@defvr {GenericModuleConfiguration} GenericRateMultiply @var{num}
@end defvr
@defvr {GenericModuleConfiguration} GenericPitchAdd @var{num}
@end defvr
@defvr {GenericModuleConfiguration} GenericPitchMultiply @var{num}
@end defvr
@defvr {GenericModuleConfiguration} GenericPitchRangeAdd @var{num}
@end defvr
@defvr {GenericModuleConfiguration} GenericPitchRangeMultiply @var{num}
These parameters set rate and pitch conversion to compute
the value of @code{$RATE}, @code{$PITCH} and @code{$PITCH_RANGE}.

The resulting rate (or pitch) is calculated using the following formula:
@example
   (speechd_rate * GenericRateMultiply) + GenericRateAdd
@end example
where speechd_rate is a value between -100 (lowest) and +100 (highest)
Some meaningful conversion for the specific text-to-speech system
used must by defined.

(The values in GenericSthMultiply are multiplied by 100 because
DotConf currently doesn't support floats. So you can write 0.85 as 85 and
so on.)

@section Synthesis Output Modules
@cindex output module
@cindex different synthesizers

Speech Dispatcher supports concurrent use of multiple output modules.  If the
output modules provide good synchronization, you can combine them when
reading messages.  For example if module1 can speak English and Czech while
module2 speaks only German, the idea is that if there is some message in
German, module2 is used, while module1 is used for the other languages.
However the language is not the only criteria for the decision.  The rules for
selection of an output module can be influenced through the configuration file
@file{speech-dispatcher/speechd.conf}.

@itemize @bullet

@item Festival
Festival is a free software multi-language Text-to-Speech
synthesis system that is very flexible and extensible using the
Scheme scripting language. Currently, it supports high quality
synthesis for several languages, and on today's computers it runs
reasonably fast.  If you are not sure which one to use and your
language is supported by Festival, we advise you to use it. See
@uref{http://www.cstr.ed.ac.uk/projects/festival/}.

@item eSpeak
eSpeak is a newer very lightweight free software engine with a broad
range of supported languages and a good quality of voice at high
rates. See @uref{http://espeak.sourceforge.net/}.

@item Flite
Flite (Festival Light) is a lightweight free software TTS synthesizer
intended to run on systems with limited resources. At this time, it
has only one English voice and porting voices from Festival looks
rather difficult.  With the caching mechanism provided by Speech
Dispatcher, Festival is faster than Flite in most situations.  See
@uref{http://www.speech.cs.cmu.edu/flite/}.

@item Generic
The Generic module can be used with any synthesizer that can be
managed by a simple command line application. @xref{Configuration of
the Generic Output Module}, for more details about how to use it.
However, it provides only very rudimentary support of speaking.

@item Pico
The SVOX Pico engine is a software speech synthesizer for German, English (GB

@node Security,  , Synthesis Output Modules, User's Documentation
@section Security

Speech Dispatcher doesn't implement any special authentication
mechanisms but uses the standard system mechanisms to regulate access.

If the default `unix_socket' communication mechanism is used, only the
user who starts the server can connect to it due to imposed
restrictions on the unix socket file permissions.

In case of the `inet_socket' communication mechanism, where clients
connect to Speech Dispatcher on a specified port, theoretically
everyone could connect to it. The access is by default restricted only
for connections originating on the same machine, which can be changed
via the LocalhostAccessOnly option in the server configuration
file. In such a case, the user is reponsible to set appropriate
security restrictions on the access to the given port on his machine
from the outside network using a firewall or similar mechanism.

@node Communication mechanisms, Address specification, Technical Specifications, Technical Specifications
@section Communication mechanisms

Speech Dispatcher supports two communicatino mechanisms: UNIX-style
and Inet sockets, which are refered as 'unix-socket' and 'inet-socket'
respectively. The communication mechanism is decided on startup and
cannot be changed at runtime. Unix sockets are now the default and
preferred variant for local communication, Inet sockets are necessary
for communication over network.

The mechanism for the decision of which method to use is as follows in
this order of precedence: command-line option, configuration option,
the default value 'unix-socket'.

@emph{Unix sockets} are associated with a file in the filesystem. By
default, this file is placed in the user's runtime directory (as
determined by the value of the XDG_RUNTIME_DIR environment variable and the
system configuration for the given user). It's default name is
constructed as @code{XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/speech-dispatcher/speechd.sock}. The access
permissions for this file are set to 600 so that it's restricted to
read/write by the current user.

As such, access is handled properly and there are no conflicts between
the different instances of Speech Dispatcher run by the different
users.

Client applications and libraries are supposed to independently
replicate the process of construction of the socket path and connect
to it, thus establishing a common communication channel in the default
setup.

It should be however possible in the client libraries and is possible
in the server, to define a custom file as a socket name if needed.
Client libraries should respect the @var{SPEECHD_ADDRESS} environment
variable.

@emph{Inet sockets} are based on communication over a given port on
the given host, two variables which must be previously agreed between
the server and client before a connection can be established. The only
implicit security restriction is the server configuration option which
can allow or disallow access from machines other than localhost.

By convention, the clients should use host and port given by one of
the following sources in the following order of precedence: its own
configuration, value of the @var{SPEECHD_ADDRESS} environment variable
and the default pair (localhost, 6560).

@xref{Setting Communication Method}.

@node Address specification, Actions performed on startup, Communication mechanisms, Technical Specifications
@section Address specification

Speech Dispatcher provies several methods of communication and can be
used both locally and over network. @xref{Communication
mechanisms}. Client applications and interface libraries need to
recognize an address, which specifies how and where to contact the
appropriate server.

Address specification consits from the method and one or more of its
parameters, each item separated by a colon:

@example
method:parameter1:parameter2
@end example

The method is either 'unix_socket' or 'inet_socket'. Parameters are
optional.  If not used in the address line, their default value will
be used.

Two forms are currently recognized:

@example
unix_socket:full/path/to/socket
inet_socket:host_ip:port
@end example

Examples of valid address lines are:
@example
unix_socket
unix_socket:/tmp/test.sock
inet_socket
inet_socket:192.168.0.34
inet_socket:192.168.0.34:6563
@end example

Clients implement different mechanisms how the user can set the
address. Clients should respect the @var{SPEECHD_ADDRESS} environment
variable @xref{Setting Communication Method}, unless the user
ovverrides its value by settins in the client application
itself. Clients should fallback to the default address, if neither the
environment variable or their specific configuration is set.

The default communication address currently is:

@example
unix_socket:/$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/speech-dispatcher/speechd.sock
@end example

where `~' stands for the path to the users home directory.

@node Actions performed on startup, Accepted signals, Address specification, Technical Specifications
@section Actions performed on startup

What follows is an overview of the actions the server takes on startup
in this order:

@itemize @bullet

@item Initialize logging stage 1

Set loglevel to 1 and log destination to stderr (logfile is not ready yet).

@item Parse command line options

Read preferred communication method, destinations for logfile and pidfile

@item Establish the @file{~/.config/speech-dispatcher/} and
@file{~/.cache/speech-dispatcher/} directories

If pid and conf paths were not given as command line options, the
server will place them in @file{~/.config/speech-dispatcher/} and
@file{~/.cache/speech-dispatcher/} by default. If they
are not specified AND the current user doesn't have a system home directory,
the server will fail startup.

The configuration file is pointed to @file{~/.config/speech-dispatcher/speechd.conf}
if it exists, otherwise to @file{/etc/speech-dispatcher/speechd.conf} or a similar
system location according to compile options. One of these files must
exists, otherwise Speech Dispatcher will not know where to find its output
modules.

@item Create pid file

Check the pid file in the determined location. If an instance of the
server is already running, log an error message and exit with error
code 1, otherwise create and lock a new pid file.

@item Check for autospawning enabled

If the server is started with --spawn, check whether autospawn is not
disabled in the configuration (DisableAutoSpawn config option in
speechd.conf). If it is disabled, log an error message and exit with
error code 1.

@item Install signal handlers

@item Create unix or inet sockets and start listening

@item Initialize Speech Dispatcher

Read the configuration files, setup some lateral threads, start and
initialize output modules. Reinitialize logging (stage 2) into the
final logfile destination (as determined by the command line option,
the configuration option and the default location in this order of
precedence).

After this step, Speech Dispatcher is ready to accept new connections.

@item Daemonize the process

Fork the process, disconnect from standard input and outputs,
disconnect from parent process etc. as prescribed by the POSIX
standards.

@item Initialize the speaking lateral thread

Initialize the second main thread which will process the speech
request from the queues and pass them onto the Speech Dispatcher
modules.


@item Start accepting new connections from clients

Start listening for new connections from clients and processing them
in a loop.

@end itemize

@chapter Client Programming

Clients communicate with Speech Dispatcher via the Speech Synthesis
Internet Protocol (SSIP) @xref{Top, , , ssip, Speech Synthesis
Internet Protocol documentation}.  The protocol is the actual
interface to Speech Dispatcher.

Usually you don't need to use SSIP directly.  You can use one of the supplied
libraries, which wrap the SSIP interface.  This is the
recommended way of communicating with Speech Dispatcher.  We try so support as
many programming environments as possible.  This manual (except SSIP) contains
documentation for the C and Python libraries, however there are also other
libraries developed as external projects.  Please contact us for information
about current external client libraries.

@subsection Initializing and Terminating

@deffn {C API function} SPDConnection* spd_open(char* client_name, char* connection_name, char* user_name, SPDConnectionMode connection_mode)
@findex spd_open()

Opens a new connection to Speech Dispatcher and returns a socket file
descriptor you will use to communicate with Speech Dispatcher. The
socket file descriptor is a parameter used in all the other
functions. It now uses local communication via inet sockets.
See @code{spd_open2} for more details.

The three parameters @code{client_name}, @code{connection_name} and
@code{username} are there only for informational and navigational
purposes, they don't affect any settings or behavior of any
functions. The authentication mechanism has nothing to do with
@code{username}. These parameters are important for the user when he
wants to set some parameters for a given session, when he wants to
browse through history, etc. The parameter @code{connection_mode}
specifies how this connection should be handled internally and if
event notifications and index marking capabilities will be available.

@code{client_name} is the name of the client that opens the connection. Normally,
it should be the name of the executable, for example ``lynx'', ``emacs'', ``bash'',
or ``gcc''. It can be left as NULL.

@code{connection_name} determines the particular use of that connection. If you
use only one connection in your program, this should be set to ``main'' (passing
a NULL pointer has the same effect). If you use two or more connections in
your program, their @code{client_name}s should be the same, but @code{connection_name}s
should differ. For example: ``buffer'', ``command_line'', ``text'', ``menu''.

@code{username} should be set to the name of the user. Normally, you should
get this string from the system. If set to NULL, libspeechd will try to
determine it automatically by g_get_user_name().

@code{connection_mode} has two possible values: @code{SPD_MODE_SINGLE}
and @code{SPD_MODE_THREADED}. If the parameter is set to
@code{SPD_MODE_THREADED}, then @code{spd_open()} will open an
additional thread in your program which will handle asynchronous SSIP
replies and will allow you to use callbacks for event notifications
and index marking, allowing you to keep track of the progress
of speaking the messages. However, you must be aware that your
program is now multi-threaded and care must be taken when
using/handling signals. If @code{SPD_MODE_SINGLE} is chosen, the
library won't execute any additional threads and SSIP will run only as
a synchronous protocol, therefore event notifications and index
marking won't be available.

It returns a newly allocated SPDConnection* structure on success, or @code{NULL}
on error.

Each connection you open should be closed by spd_close() before the
end of the program, so that the associated connection descriptor is
closed, threads are terminated and memory is freed.

@end deffn

@deffn {C API function} SPDConnection* spd_open2(char* client_name, char* connection_name, char* user_name, SPDConnectionMode connection_mode, SPDConnectionMethod method, int autospawn)
@findex spd_open2()

Opens a new connection to Speech Dispatcher and returns a socket file
descriptor. This function is the same as @code{spd_open} except that
it gives more control of the communication method and autospawn
functionality as described below.

@code{method} is either @code{SPD_METHOD_UNIX_SOCKET} or @code{SPD_METHOD_INET_SOCKET}. By default,
unix socket communication should be preferred, but inet sockets are necessary for cross-network
communication.

@code{autospawn} is a boolean flag specifying whether the function
should try to autospawn (autostart) the Speech Dispatcher server
process if it is not running already. This is set to 1 by default, so
this function should normally not fail even if the server is not yet
running.

@end deffn

@deffn {C API function}  void spd_close(SPDConnection *connection)
@findex spd_close()

Closes a Speech Dispatcher socket connection, terminates associated
threads (if necessary) and frees the memory allocated by
spd_open(). You should close every connection before the end of your
program.

@code{connection} is the SPDConnection connection obtained by spd_open().

@subsection Speech Synthesis Commands

@defvar {C API type} SPDPriority
@vindex SPDPriority

@code{SPDPriority} is an enum type that represents the possible priorities that
can be assigned to a message.

@example
typedef enum@{
    SPD_IMPORTANT = 1,
    SPD_MESSAGE = 2,
    SPD_TEXT = 3,
    SPD_NOTIFICATION = 4,
    SPD_PROGRESS = 5

@xref{Top,,Message Priority Model,ssip, SSIP Documentation}.

@end defvar

@deffn {C API function}  int spd_say(SPDConnection* connection, SPDPriority priority, char* text);
@findex spd_say()

Sends a message to Speech Dispatcher. If this message isn't blocked by
some message of higher priority and this CONNECTION isn't paused, it
will be synthesized directly on one of the output devices. Otherwise,
the message will be discarded or delayed according to its priority.

@code{connection} is the SPDConnection* connection created by spd_open().

@code{priority} is the desired priority for this message. @xref{Top,,Message Priority Model,ssip, SSIP Documentation}.

@code{text} is a null terminated string containing text you want sent
to synthesis. It must be encoded in UTF-8. Note that this doesn't have
to be what you will finally hear. It can be affected by different
settings, such as spelling, punctuation, text substitution etc.

It returns a positive unique message identification number on success,
-1 otherwise.  This message identification number can be saved and
used for the purpose of event notification callbacks or history
handling.

@end deffn

@deffn {C API function}  int spd_sayf(SPDConnection* connection, SPDPriority priority, char* format, ...);
@findex spd_sayf()

Similar to @code{spd_say()}, simulates the behavior of printf().

@code{format} is a string containing text and formatting of the parameters, such as ``%d'',
``%s'' etc. It must be encoded in UTF-8.

@code{...} is an arbitrary number of arguments.

All other parameters are the same as for spd_say().

For example:
@example
       spd_sayf(conn, SPD_TEXT, "Hello %s, how are you?", username);
       spd_sayf(conn, SPD_IMPORTANT, "Fatal error on [%s:%d]", filename, line);
@end example

But be careful with unicode! For example this doesn't work:

@example
       spd_sayf(conn, SPD_NOTIFY, ``Pressed key is %c.'', key);
@end example

Why? Because you are supposing that key is a char, but that will
fail with languages using multibyte charsets. The proper solution
is:

@example
       spd_sayf(conn, SPD_NOTIFY, ``Pressed key is %s'', key);
@end example
where key is an encoded string.

It returns a positive unique message identification number on success, -1 otherwise.
This message identification number can be saved and used for the purpose of
event notification callbacks or history handling.

waiting in queues). This is intended for stops executed by the user,
not for automatic stops (because automatically you can't control

The same as spd_stop() except that it stops a client client different from
the calling one. You must specify this client in @code{target_uid}.

@code{target_uid} is the unique ID of the connection you want
to execute stop() on. It can be obtained from spd_history_get_client_list().

@subsubheading Cancel Commands

@deffn {C API function}  int spd_cancel(SPDConnection* connection);

Stops the currently spoken message from this connection
(if there is any) and discards all the queued messages
from this connection. This is probably what you want
to do, when you call spd_cancel() automatically in
your program.
@end deffn

@deffn {C API function}  int spd_cancel_all(SPDConnection* connection);

@end deffn

@subsubheading Pause Commands

@deffn {C API function}  int spd_pause(SPDConnection* connection);
@findex int spd_pause()

Pauses all messages received from the given connection. No messages
except for priority @code{notification} and @code{progress} are thrown
away, they are all waiting in a separate queue for resume(). Upon resume(), the
message that was being said at the moment pause() was received will be
continued from the place where it was paused.

It returns immediately. However, that doesn't mean that the speech
output will stop immediately. Instead, it can continue speaking
the message for a while until a place where the position in the text
can be determined exactly is reached. This is necessary to be able to
provide `resume' without gaps and overlapping.

When pause is on for the given client, all newly received
messages are also queued and waiting for resume().

It returns 0 on success, -1 if something failed.
@end deffn

@deffn {C API function}  int spd_pause_all(SPDConnection* connection);

@node Event Notification and Index Marking in C, History Commands in C, Information Retrieval Commands in C, C API
@subsection Event Notification and Index Marking in C

When the SSIP connection is run in asynchronous mode, it is possible
to register callbacks for all the SSIP event notifications and index
mark notifications, as defined in @ref{Message Event Notification
and Index Marking,,, ssip, SSIP Documentation}

@defvar {C API type} SPDNotification
@vindex SPDNotification
@anchor{SPDNotification}

@code{SPDNotification} is an enum type that represents the possible
base notification types that can be assigned to a message.

@example
typedef enum@{
    SPD_BEGIN = 1,
    SPD_END = 2,
    SPD_INDEX_MARKS = 4,
    SPD_CANCEL = 8,
    SPD_PAUSE = 16,
    SPD_RESUME = 32
@}SPDNotification;
@end example
@end defvar

There are currently two types of callbacks in the C API.

@defvar {C API type} SPDCallback
@vindex SPDCallback
@anchor{SPDCallback}
@code{void (*SPDCallback)(size_t msg_id, size_t client_id, SPDNotificationType state);}

This one is used for notifications about the events: @code{BEGIN}, @code{END}, @code{PAUSE}
and @code{RESUME}. When the callback is called, it provides three parameters for the event.

@code{msg_id} unique identification number of the message the notification is about.

@code{client_id} specifies the unique identification number of the client who sent the
message. This is usually the same connection as the connection which registered this
callback, and therefore uninteresting. However, in some special cases it might be useful
to register this callback for other SSIP connections, or register the same callback for
several connections originating from the same application.

@code{state} is the @code{SPD_Notification} type of this notification. @xref{SPDNotification}.
@end defvar

@defvar {C API type} SPDCallbackIM
@vindex SPDCallbackIM
@code{void (*SPDCallbackIM)(size_t msg_id, size_t client_id, SPDNotificationType state,
char *index_mark);}

@code{SPDCallbackIM} is used for notifications about index marks that have been reached
in the message.  (A way to specify index marks is e.g. through the SSML element
<mark/> in ssml mode.)

The syntax and meaning of these parameters are the same as for @ref{SPDCallback}
except for the additional parameter @code{index_mark}.

@code{index_mark} is a NULL terminated string associated with the index mark. Please
note that this string is specified by client application and therefore it needn't be
unique.
@end defvar

One or more callbacks can be supplied for a given @code{SPDConnection*} connection by
assigning the values of pointers to the appropriate functions to the following connection
members:

@example
    SPDCallback callback_begin;
    SPDCallback callback_end;
    SPDCallback callback_cancel;
    SPDCallback callback_pause;
    SPDCallback callback_resume;
    SPDCallbackIM callback_im;
@end example

There are three settings commands which will turn notifications on and
off for the current SSIP connection and cause the callbacks to be called
when the event is registered by Speech Dispatcher.

@deffn {C API function} int spd_set_notification_on(SPDConnection* connection, SPDNotification notification);
@findex spd_set_notification_on
@end deffn
@deffn {C API function} int spd_set_notification_off(SPDConnection* connection, SPDNotification notification);
@findex spd_set_notification_off
@end deffn
@deffn {C API function} int spd_set_notification(SPDConnection* connection, SPDNotification notification, const char* state);
@findex spd_set_notification

These functions will set the notification specified by the parameter
@code{notification} on or off (or to the given value)
respectively. Note that it is only safe to call these functions after
the appropriate callback functions have been set in the @code{SPDCallback}
structure. Doing otherwise is not considered an error, but the
application might miss some events due to callback functions not being
executed (e.g. the client might receive an @code{END} event without
receiving the corresponding @code{BEGIN} event in advance.

@code{connection} is the SPDConnection* connection created by spd_open().

@code{notification} is the requested type of notifications that should be reported by SSIP. @xref{SPDNotification}.
Note that also '|' combinations are possible, as illustrated in the example below.

@code{state} must be either the string ``on'' or ``off'', for switching the given notification on or off.

@end deffn

The following example shows how to use callbacks for the simple
purpose of playing a message and waiting until its end. (Please note
that checks of return values in this example as well as other code
not directly related to index marking, have been removed for the purpose
of clarity.)

@example
#include <semaphore.h>

sem_t semaphore;

/* Callback for Speech Dispatcher notifications */
void end_of_speech(size_t msg_id, size_t client_id, SPDNotificationType type)
@{
   /* We don't check msg_id here since we will only send one
       message. */

   /* Callbacks are running in a separate thread, so let the
       (sleeping) main thread know about the event and wake it up. */
   sem_post(&semaphore);
@}

int
main(int argc, char **argv)
@{
   SPDConnection *conn;

   sem_init(&semaphore, 0, 0);

   /* Open Speech Dispatcher connection in THREADED mode. */
   conn = spd_open("say","main", NULL, SPD_MODE_THREADED);

   /* Set callback handler for 'end' and 'cancel' events. */
   conn->callback_end = con->callback_cancel = end_of_speech;

   /* Ask Speech Dispatcher to notify us about these events. */
   spd_set_notification_on(conn, SPD_END);
   spd_set_notification_on(conn, SPD_CANCEL);

   /* Say our message. */
   spd_sayf(conn, SPD_MESSAGE, (char*) argv[1]);

   /* Wait for 'end' or 'cancel' of the sent message.
      By SSIP specifications, we are guaranteed to get
      one of these two eventually. */
   sem_wait(&semaphore);

   return 0;

@subsection Direct SSIP Communication in C

It might happen that you want to use some SSIP function that is not
available through a library or you may want to use an available
function in a different manner. (If you think there is something
missing in a library or you have some useful comment on the
available functions, please let us know.) For this purpose, there are
a few functions that will allow you to send arbitrary SSIP commands on
your connection and read the replies.

@deffn {C API function} int spd_execute_command(SPDConnection* connection, char *command);
@findex spd_execute_command()

You can send an arbitrary SSIP command specified in the parameter @code{command}.

If the command is successful, the function returns a 0. If there is no such
command or the command failed for some reason, it returns -1.

@code{connection} is the SPDConnection* connection created by spd_open().

@code{command} is a null terminated string containing a full SSIP command
without the terminating sequence @code{\r\n}.

For example:
@example
        spd_execute_command(fd, "SET SELF RATE 60");
        spd_execute_command(fd, "SOUND_ICON bell");
@end example

It's not possible to use this function for compound commands like @code{SPEAK}
where you are receiving more than one reply. If this is your case, please
see `spd_send_data()'.
@end deffn

@deffn {C API function} char* spd_send_data(SPDConnection* connection, const char *message, int wfr);
@findex spd_send_data()

You can send an arbitrary SSIP string specified in the parameter @code{message}
and, if specified, wait for the reply. The string can be any SSIP command, but
it can also be textual data or a command parameter.

If @code{wfr} (wait for reply) is set to SPD_WAIT_REPLY, you will receive the reply string
as the return value. If wfr is set to SPD_NO_REPLY, the return value is a NULL pointer.
If wfr is set to SPD_WAIT_REPLY, you should always free the returned string.

@code{connection} is the SPDConnection* connection created by spd_open().

@code{message} is a null terminated string containing a full SSIP
string.  If this is a complete SSIP command, it must include the full
terminating sequence @code{\r\n}.

@code{wfr} is either SPD_WAIT_REPLY (integer value of 1) or SPD_NO_REPLY (0).
This specifies if you expect to get a reply on the sent data according to SSIP.
For example, if you are sending ordinary text inside a @code{SPEAK} command,
you don't expect to get a reply, but you expect a reply after sending the final
sequence @code{\r\n.\r\n}.

For example (simplified by not checking and freeing the returned strings):
@example
        spd_send_data(conn, "SPEAK", SPD_WAIT_REPLY);
        spd_send_data(conn, "Hello world!\n", SPD_NO_REPLY);
        spd_send_data(conn, "How are you today?!", SPD_NO_REPLY);
        spd_send_data(conn, "\r\n.\r\n.", SPD_WAIT_REPLY);
@end example

@node Python API, Guile API, C API, Client Programming
@section Python API

There is a full Python API available in @file{src/python/speechd/} in
the source tree.  Please see the Python docstrings for full reference
about the available objects and methods.

Simple Python client:
@example
import speechd
client = speechd.SSIPClient('test')
client.set_output_module('festival')
client.set_language('en-US')
client.set_punctuation(speechd.PunctuationMode.SOME)
client.speak("Hello World!")
client.close()
@end example

The Python API respects the environment variables
@var{SPEECHD_ADDRESS} it the communication address is not specified
explicitly (see @code{SSIPClient} constructor arguments).

Implementation of callbacks within the Python API tries to hide the
low level details of SSIP callback handling and provide a convenient
Pythonic interface.  You just pass a callable object (function) to the
@code{speak()} method and this function will be called whenever an
event occurs for the corresponding message.

Callback example:
@example
import speechd, time
called = []
client = speechd.SSIPClient('callback-test')
client.speak("Hi!", callback=lambda cb_type: called.append(cb_type))
time.sleep(2) # Wait for the events to happen.
print "Called callbacks:", called
client.close()
@end example

Real-world callback functions will most often need some sort of
context information to be able to distinguish for which message the
callback was called.  This can be simply done in Python.  The
following example uses the actual message text as the context
information within the callback function.

Callback context example:
@example
import speechd, time

class CallbackExample(object):
    def __init__(self):
        self._client = speechd.SSIPClient('callback-test')

    def speak(self, text):
        def callback(callback_type):
            if callback_type == speechd.CallbackType.BEGIN:
                print "Speech started:", text
            elif callback_type == speechd.CallbackType.END:
                print "Speech completed:", text
            elif callback_type == speechd.CallbackType.CANCEL:
                print "Speech interupted:", text

                                        speechd.CallbackType.END))

    def go(self):

        time.sleep(4) # Wait for the events to happen.
        self._client.close()

@end example

@emph{Important notice:} The callback is called in Speech Dispatcher
listener thread.  No subsequent Speech Dispatcher interaction is
allowed from within the callback invocation.  If you need to do
something more complicated, do it in another thread to prevent
deadlocks in SSIP communication.

@node Autospawning,  , Common Lisp API, Client Programming
@section Autospawning

It is suggested that client libraries offer an autospawn functionality
to automatically start the server process when connecting locally and if
it is not already running. E.g. if the client application starts and
Speech Dispatcher is not running already, the client will start Speech
Dispatcher.

The library API should provide a possibility to turn this
functionality off, but we suggest to set the default behavior to
autospawn.

Autospawn is performed by executing Speech Dispatcher with the --spawn
parameter under the same user and permissions as the client process:

@example
speech-dispatcher --spawn
@end example

With the @code{--spawn} parameter, the process will start and return
with an exit code of 0 only if a) it is not already running (pidfile
check) b) the server doesn't have autospawn disabled in its
configuration c) no other error preventing the start
occurs. Otherwise, Speech Dispatcher is not started and the error code
of 1 is returned.

The client library should redirect its stdout and stderr outputs
either to nowhere or to its logging system. It should subsequently
completely detach from the newly spawned process.

Due to a bug in Speech Dispatcher, it is currently necessary to
include a wait statement after the autospawn for about 0.5 seconds
before attempting a connection.

Please see how autospawn is implemented in the C API and in the Python
API for an example.

@section Server Core

The main documentation for the server core is the code itself. This section
is only a general introduction intended to give you some basic information
and hints where to look for things. If you are going to make some modifications
in the server core, we will be happy if you get in touch with us on
@email{speechd-discuss@@nongnu.org}.

The server core is composed of two main parts, each of them implemented
in a separate thread. The @emph{server part} handles the communication
with clients and, with the desired configuration options, stores the messages
in the priority queue. The @emph{speaking part} takes care of
communicating with the output modules, pulls messages out of the priority
queue at the correct time and sends them to the appropriate synthesizer.

Synchronization between these two parts is done by thread mutexes.
Additionally, synchronization of the speaking part from both sides
(server part, output modules) is done via a SYSV/IPC semaphore.

@subheading Server part

After switching to the daemon mode (if required), it reads configuration
files and initializes the speaking part. Then it opens the socket
and waits for incoming data. This is implemented mainly in
@file{src/server/speechd.c} and @file{src/server/server.c}.

There are three types of events: new client connects to speechd,
old client disconnects, or a client sends some data. In the third
case, the data is passed to the @code{parse()} function defined
in @file{src/server/parse.c}.

If the incoming data is a new message, it's stored in a
queue according to its priority. If it is SSIP
commands, it's handled by the appropriate handlers.
Handling of the @code{SET} family of commands can be found
in @file{src/server/set.c} and @code{HISTORY} commands are
processed in @file{src/server/history.c}.

All reply messages of SSIP are defined in @file{src/server/msg.h}.

@subheading Speaking part

This thread, the function @code{speak()} defined in
@file{src/server/speaking.c}, is created from the server part process
shortly after initialization. Then it enters an infinite loop and
waits on a SYSV/IPC semaphore until one of the following actions
happen:

@itemize @bullet
@item
The server adds a new message to the queue of messages waiting
to be said.
@item
The currently active output module signals that the message
that was being spoken is done.
@item
Pause or resume is requested.
@end itemize

After handling the rest of the priority interaction (like actions
needed to repeat the last priority progress message) it decides
which action should be performed. Usually it's picking up
a message from the queue and sending it to the desired output
module (synthesizer), but sometimes it's handling the pause
or resume requests, and sometimes it's doing nothing.

As said before, this is the part of Speech Dispatcher that
talks to the output modules. It does so by using the output
interface defined in @file{src/server/output.c}.

@node Basic Structure, Communication Protocol for Output Modules, Output Modules, Output Modules
@subsection Basic Structure

Speech Dispatcher output modules are independent applications that,
using a simple common communication protocol, read commands from
standard input and then output replies on standard output,
communicating the requests to the particular software or hardware
synthesizer. Everything the output module writes on standard output
or reads from standard input should conform to the specifications
of the communication protocol. Additionally, standard error output
is used for logging of the modules.

Output module binaries are usually located in
@file{bin/speechd-modules/} and are loaded automatically when Speech
Dispatcher starts, according to configuration.  Their standard
input/output/error output is redirected to a pipe to Speech Dispatcher
and this way both sides can communicate.

When the modules start, they are passed the name of a configuration file
that should be used for this particular output module.

Each output module is started by Speech Dispatcher as:

@example
my_module "configfile"
@end example

where @code{configfile} is the full path to the desired configuration
file that the output module should parse.

@node Communication Protocol for Output Modules, How to Write New Output Module, Basic Structure, Output Modules
@subsection Communication Protocol for Output Modules

The protocol by which the output modules communicate on standard
input/output is based on @ref{Top,,SSIP,ssip, SSIP
Documentation}, although it is highly simplified and a little bit
modified for the different purpose here. Another difference
is that event notification is obligatory in modules communication,
while in SSIP, this is an optional feature. This is because Speech
Dispatcher has to know all the events happening in the output modules
for the purpose of synchronization of various messages.

Since it's very similar to SSIP, @ref{Top,,General Rules,ssip, SSIP
Documentation}, for a general description of what the protocol looks
like. One of the exceptions is that since the output modules
communicate on standard input/output, we use only @code{LF} as the
line separator.

The return values are:
@itemize
@item 2xx         OK
@item 3xx         CLIENT ERROR or BAD SYNTAX or INVALID VALUE
@item 4xx         OUTPUT MODULE ERROR or INTERNAL ERROR

@item 700         EVENT INDEX MARK
@item 701         EVENT BEGIN
@item 702         EVENT END
@item 703         EVENT STOP
@item 704         EVENT PAUSE
@end itemize

@table @code
@item SPEAK
Start receiving a text message in the SSML format and synthesize it.
After sending a reply to the command, output module waits for the text
of the message.  The text can spread over any number of lines and is
finished by an end of line marker followed by the line containing the
single character @code{.} (dot).  Thus the complete character sequence
closing the input text is @code{LF . LF}.  If any line within the sent
text contains only a dot, an extra dot should be prepended before it.

During reception of the text message, output module doesn't send a
response to the particular lines sent.  The response line is sent only
immediately after the @code{SPEAK} command and after receiving the
closing dot line. This doesn't provide any means of synchronization,
instead, event notification is used for this purpose.

There is no explicit upper limit on the size of the text.

If the @code{SPEAK} command is received while the output module
is already speaking, it is considered an error.

Example:
@example
SPEAK
202 OK SEND DATA
<speak>
Hello, GNU!
</speak>
.
200 OK SPEAKING
@end example

After receiving the full text (or the first part of it), the output
module is supposed to start synthesizing it and take care of
delivering it to an audio device. When (or just before) the first
synthesized samples are delivered to the audio and start playing, the
output module must send the @code{BEGIN} event over the communication
socket to Speech Dispatcher, @xref{Events notification and index
marking}. After the audio stops playing, the event @code{STOP},
@code{PAUSE} or @code{END} must be delivered to Speech
Dispatcher. Additionally, if supported by the given synthesizer, the
output module can issue events associated with the included SSML index
marks when they are reached in the audio output.

@item CHAR
Synthesize a character. If the synthesizer supports a different behavior
for the event of ``character'', this should be used.

It works like the command @code{SPEAK} above, except that the argument
has to be exactly one line long. It contains the UTF-8 form of exactly
one character.

@item KEY
Synthesize a key name. If the synthesizer supports a different behavior
for the event of ``key name'', this should be used.

It works like the command @code{SPEAK} above, except that the argument
has to be exactly one line long. @xref{Top, ,SSIP KEY,ssip, SSIP
Documentation}, for the description of the allowed arguments.

@item SOUND_ICON
Produce a sound icon. According to the configuration of the particular
synthesizer, this can produce either a sound (e.g. .wav) or synthesize
some text.

It works like the command @code{SPEAK} above, except that the argument
has to be exactly one line long. It contains the symbolic name of the
icon that should be said. @xref{Top,,SSIP SOUND_ICON, ssip, SSIP
Documentation}, for more detailed description of the sound icons
mechanism.

@item STOP
Immediately stop speaking on the output device and cancel synthesizing
the current message so that the output module is prepared to receive a
new message. If there is currently no message being synthesized, it is
not considered an error to call @code{STOP} anyway.

This command is asynchronous. The output module is not supposed to
send any reply (not even error reply).

It should return immediately, although stopping the synthesizer may
require a little bit more time. The module must issue one of the events
@code{STOPPED} or @code{END} when the module is finally
stopped. @code{END} is issued when the playing stopped by itself
before the module could terminate it or if the architecture of the
output module doesn't allow it to decide, otherwise @code{STOPPED}
should be used.

@example
STOP
@end example

@item PAUSE
Stop speaking the current message at a place where we can exactly
determine the position (preferably after a @code{__spd_} index mark).  This
doesn't have to be immediate and can be delayed even for a few
seconds. (Knowing the position exactly is important so that we can
later continue the message without gaps or overlapping.) It doesn't do
anything else (like storing the message etc.).

This command is asynchronous. The output module is not supposed to
send any reply (not even error reply).

For example:
@example
PAUSE
@end example

@item SET
Set one of several speech parameters for the future messages.

Each of the parameters is written on a single line in the form
@example
name=value
@end example
where @code{value} can be either a number or a string, depending upon
the name of the parameter.

The @code{SET} environment is terminated by a dot on a single line.
Thus the complete character sequence closing the input text is
@code{LF . LF}

During reception of the settings, output module doesn't send any
response to the particular lines sent.  The response line is sent only
immediately after the @code{SET} command and after receiving the
closing dot line.

The available parameters that accept numerical values are @code{rate},
@code{pitch} and @code{pitch_range}.

The available parameters that accept string values are
@code{punctuation_mode}, @code{spelling_mode}, @code{cap_let_recogn},
@code{voice}, and @code{language}.  The arguments are the same as for the
corresponding SSIP commands, except that they are written with small
letters. @xref{Top,,Parameter Setting Commands,ssip, SSIP
Documentation}.  The conversion between these string values and the
corresponding C enum variables can be easily done using
@file{src/common/fdsetconv.c}.

Not all of these parameters must be set and the value of the string
arguments can also be @code{NULL}. If some of the parameters aren't
set, the output module should use its default.

It's not necessary to set these parameters on the synthesizer right
away, instead, it can be postponed until some message to be spoken arrives.

Here is an example:
@example
SET
203 OK RECEIVING SETTINGS
rate=20
pitch=-10
pitch_range=50
punctuation_mode=all
spelling_mode=on
punctuation_some=NULL
.
203 OK SETTINGS RECEIVED
@end example

@item AUDIO
Audio has exactly the same structure as @code{SET}, but is transmitted
only once immediatelly after @code{INIT} to transmit the requested audio
parameters and tell the output module to open the audio device.

@item QUIT
Terminates the output module. It should send the response, deallocate
all the resources, close all descriptors, terminate all child
processes etc. Then the output module should exit itself.

@example
QUIT
210 OK QUIT
@end example
@end table

@subsubsection Events notification and index marking
@anchor{Events notification and index marking}

Each output module must take care of sending asynchronous
notifications whenever the synthesizer (or the module) starts or stops
output audio on the speakers. Additionally, whenever possible, the
output module should report back to Speech Dispatcher index marks
found in the incoming SSML text whenever they are reached while
speaking. See SSML specifications for more details about the
@code{mark} element

Event and index mark notifications are reported by simply writing them
to the standard output. An event notification must never get in
between synchronous commands (those which require a reply) and their
reply. Before Speech Dispatcher sends any new requests (like
@code{SET}, @code{SPEAK} etc.) it waits for the previous request to be
terminated by the output module by signalling @code{STOP}, @code{END}
or @code{PAUSE} index marks. So the only thing the output module must
ensure in order to satisfy this requirement is that it doesn't send
any index marks until it acknowledges the receival of the new message
via @code{200 OK SPEAKING}. It must also ensure that index marks
written to the pipe are well ordered -- of course it doesn't make any
sense and it is an error to send any index marks after @code{STOP},
@code{END} or @code{PAUSE} is sent.


@table @code

@item BEGIN

This event must be issued whenever the module starts to speak the
given message. If this is not possible, it can issue it when it
starts to synthesize the message or when it receives the message.

It is prepended by the code @code{701} and takes the form

@example
701 BEGIN
@end example

@item END

This event must be issued whenever the module terminates speaking the
given message because it reached its end. If this is not possible, it
can issue this event when it is ready to receive a new message after
speaking the previous message.

Each @code{END} must always be preceeded (possibly not directly) by a
@code{BEGIN}.

It is prepended by the code @code{702} and takes the form

@example
702 END
@end example

@item STOP

This event should be issued whenever the module terminates speaking
the given message without reaching its end (as a consequence of
receiving the STOP command or because of some error) not because of
a @code{PAUSE} command. When the synthesizer in use doesn't allow
the module to decide, the event @code{END} can be used instead.

Each @code{STOP} must always be preceeded (possibly not directly) by a
@code{BEGIN}.

It is prepended by the code @code{703} and takes the form

@example
703 STOP
@end example

@item PAUSE

This event should be issued whenever the module terminates speaking
the given message without reaching its end because of receiving the
@code{PAUSE} command.

Each @code{PAUSE} must always be preceeded (possibly not directly) by a
@code{BEGIN}.

It is prepended by the code @code{704} and takes the form

@example
704 PAUSE
@end example

@item INDEX MARK

This event should be issued by the output module (if supported)
whenever an index mark (SSML tag @code{<mark/>}) is passed while speaking
a message. It is preceeded by the code @code{700} and takes the form

@example
700-name
700 INDEX MARK
@end example

where @code{name} is the value of the SSML attribute @code{name} in
the tag @code{<mark/>}.

@end table

@node How to Write New Output Module, The Skeleton of an Output Module, Communication Protocol for Output Modules, Output Modules
@subsection How to Write New Output Module

If you want to write your own output module, there are basically two
ways to do it. Either you can program it all yourself, which is fine
as long as you stick to the definition of an output module and its
communication protocol, or you can use our @file{module_*.c} tools.
If you use these tools, you will only have to write the core functions
like module_speak() and module_stop etc. and you will not have to
worry about the communication protocol and other formal things that
are common for all modules. Here is how you can do it using the
provided tools.

We will recommend here a basic structure of the code for an output
module you should follow, although it's perfectly ok to establish your
own if you have reasons to do so, if all the necessary functions and
data are defined somewhere in the file. For this purpose, we will use
examples from the output module for Flite (Festival Lite), so it's
recommended to keep looking at @code{flite.c} for reference.

A few rules you should respect:
@itemize
@item
The @file{module_*.c} files should be included at the specified place and
in the specified order, because they include directly some pieces of the
code and won't work in other places.
@item
If one or more new threads are used in the output module, they must block all signals.
@item
On module_close(), all lateral threads and processes should be terminated,
all memory freed. Don't assume module_close() is always called before exit()
and the sources will be freed automatically.
@item
We will be happy if all the copyrights are assigned to Brailcom, o.p.s.
in order for us to be in a better legal position against possible intruders.
@end itemize

@node The Skeleton of an Output Module, Output Module Functions, How to Write New Output Module, Output Modules
@subsection The Skeleton of an Output Module

Each output module should include @file{module_utils.h} where the
SPDMsgSettings structure is defined to be able to handle the different
speech synthesis settings.  This file also provides tools which help
with writing output modules and making the code simpler.

@example
#include "module_utils.h"
@end example

If your plugin needs the audio tools (if you take
care of the output to the soundcard instead of the synthesizer),
you also have to include @file{spd_audio.h}

@example
#include "spd_audio.h"
@end example

The definition of macros @code{MODULE_NAME} and @code{MODULE_VERSION}
should follow:

@example
#define MODULE_NAME     "flite"
#define MODULE_VERSION  "0.1"
@end example

If you want to use the @code{DBG(message)} macro from @file{module_utils.c}
to print out debugging messages, you should insert these two lines. (Please
don't use printf for debugging, this doesn't work with multiple processes!)
(You will later have to actually start debugging in @code{module_init()})

@example
DECLARE_DEBUG();
@end example

You don't have to define the prototypes of the core functions
like module_speak() and module_stop(), these are already
defined in @file{module_utils.h}

Optionally, if your output module requires some special configuration,
apart from defining voices and configuring debugging (they are handled
differently, see below), you can declare the requested option
here. It will expand into a dotconf callback and declaration of the
variable.

(You will later have to actually register these options for
Speech Dispatcher in @code{module_load()})

There are currently 4 types of possible configuration options:

@itemize
@item @code{MOD_OPTION_1_INT(name);   /* Set up `int name' */}
@item @code{MOD_OPTION_1_STR(name);   /* Set up `char* name' */}
@item @code{MOD_OPTION_2(name);       /* Set up `char *name[2]' */}
@item @code{MOD_OPTION_@{2,3@}_HT(name);  /* Set up a hash table */}
@end itemize

@xref{Output Modules Configuration}.

For example Flite uses 2 options:
@example
MOD_OPTION_1_INT(FliteMaxChunkLength);
MOD_OPTION_1_STR(FliteDelimiters);
@end example

Every output module is started in 2 phases: @emph{loading} and
@emph{initialization}.

The goal of loading is to initialize empty structures for storing
settings and declare the DotConf callbacks for parsing configuration
files. In the second phase, initialization, all the configuration has
been read and the output module can accomplish the rest (check if
the synthesizer works, set up threads etc.).

You should start with the definition of @code{module_load()}.

@example
int
module_load(void)
@{
@end example

Then you should initialize the settings tables. These are defined in
@file{module_utils.h} and will be used to store the settings received
by the @code{SET} command.
@example
    INIT_SETTINGS_TABLES();
@end example

Also, define the configuration callbacks for debugging if you use
the @code{DBG()} macro.

@example
    REGISTER_DEBUG();
@end example

Now you can finally register the options for the configuration file
parsing. Just use these macros:
@itemize
        @item MOD_OPTION_1_INT_REG(name, default);  /* for integer parameters */
        @item MOD_OPTION_1_STR_REG(name, default);  /* for string parameters */
        @item MOD_OPTION_MORE_REG(name);   /* for an array of strings */
        @item MOD_OPTION_HT_REG(name);     /* for hash tables */
@end itemize

Again, an example from Flite:
@example
    MOD_OPTION_1_INT_REG(FliteMaxChunkLength, 300);
    MOD_OPTION_1_STR_REG(FliteDelimiters, ".");
@end example

If you want to enable the mechanism for setting
voices through AddVoice, use this function (for
an example see @code{generic.c}):

Example from Festival:
@example
    module_register_settings_voices();
@end example

@xref{Output Modules Configuration}.

If everything went correctly, the function should return 0, otherwise -1.

@example
    return 0;
@}
@end example

The second phase of starting an output module is handled by:

@example
int
module_init(void)
@{
@end example

If you use the DBG() macro, you should init debugging on the start
of this function. From that moment on, you can use DBG(). Apart from that,
the body of this function is entirely up to you. You should do all the
necessary initialization of the particular synthesizer.  All declared
configuration variables and configuration hash tables, together with
the definition of voices, are filled with their values (either default
or read from configuration), so you can use them already.

@example
   INIT_DEBUG();
   DBG("FliteMaxChunkLength = %d\n", FliteMaxChunkLength);
   DBG("FliteDelimiters = %s\n", FliteDelimiters);
@end example

This function should return 0 if the module was initialized
successfully, or -1 if some failure was encountered. In this case, you
should clean up everything, cancel threads, deallocate memory etc.; no
more functions of this output module will be touched (except for other
tries to load and initialize the module).

Example from Flite:

@example
    /* Init flite and register a new voice */
    flite_init();
    flite_voice = register_cmu_us_kal();

    if (flite_voice == NULL)@{
        DBG("Couldn't register the basic kal voice.\n");
        return -1;
    @}
    [...]
@end example

The third part is opening the audio. This is commanded
by the @code{AUDIO} protocol command. If the synthesizer is able
to retrieve audio data, it is desirable to open the @code{spd_audio}
output according to the requested parameters and then use this
method for audio output. Audio initialization can be done as
follows:

@example
int
module_audio_init(char **status_info)@{
  DBG("Opening audio");
  return module_audio_init_spd(status_info);
@}
@end example

If it is impossible to retrieve audio from the synthesizer and
the synthesizer itself is used for playback, than the module must
still contain this function, but it should just return 0 and
do nothing.

Now you have to define all the synthesis control functions
@code{module_speak}, @code{module_stop} etc.  See @ref{Output Module
Functions}.

At the end, this simple include provides the main() function and all
the functionality related to being an output module of Speech
Dispatcher (parsing argv[] parameters, communicating on stdin/stdout,
...). It's recommended to study this file carefully and try to
understand what exactly it does, as it will be part of the source code
of your output module.

@example
#include "module_main.c"
@end example

If it doesn't work, it's most likely not your fault. Complain!  This
manual is not complete and the instructions in this sections aren't
either. Get in touch with us and together we can figure out what's
wrong, fix it and then warn others in this manual.

@node Output Module Functions, Module Utils Functions and Macros, The Skeleton of an Output Module, Output Modules
@subsection Output Module Functions

@deffn {Output Module Functions} int module_speak (char *data, size_t bytes, EMessageType msgtype)
@findex module_speak()

This is the function where the actual speech output is produced. It is
called every time Speech Dispatcher decides to send a message to
synthesis. The data of length @var{bytes} are passed in
a NULL terminated string @var{data}.  The argument @var{msgtype}
defines what type of message it is (different types should be handled
differently, if the synthesizer supports it).

Each output module should take care of setting the output device to
the parameters from msg_settings (defined in module_utils.h) (See
SPDMsgSettings in @file{module_utils.h}). However, it is not an error if
some of these values are ignored. At least rate, pitch and language
should be set correctly.

Speed and pitch are values between -100 and 100 included. 0 is the default
value that represents normal speech flow. So -100 is the slowest (or lowest)
and +100 is the fastest (or highest) speech.

The language parameter is given as a null-terminated string containing
the name of the language according to RFC 1766 (en, cs, fr, en-US, ...). If the
requested language is not supported by this synthesizer, it's ok to abort
and return 0, because that's an error in user settings.

An easy way to set the parameters is using the UPDATE_PARAMETER() and
UPDATE_STRING_PARAMETER() macros. @xref{Module Utils Functions and
Macros}.

Example from festival:
@example
    UPDATE_STRING_PARAMETER(language, festival_set_language);
    UPDATE_PARAMETER(voice, festival_set_voice);
    UPDATE_PARAMETER(rate, festival_set_rate);
    UPDATE_PARAMETER(pitch, festival_set_pitch);
    UPDATE_PARAMETER(punctuation_mode, festival_set_punctuation_mode);
    UPDATE_PARAMETER(cap_let_recogn, festival_set_cap_let_recogn);
@end example

This function should return 0 if it fails and 1 if the delivery
to the synthesizer is successful. It should return immediately,
because otherwise, it would block stopping, priority handling
and other important things in Speech Dispatcher.

If there is a need to stay longer, you should create a separate thread
or process. This is for example the case of some software synthesizers
which use a blocking function (eg. spd_audio_play) or hardware devices
that have to send data to output modules at some particular
speed. Note that if you use threads for this purpose, you have to set
them to ignore all signals. The simplest way to do this is to call
@code{set_speaking_thread_parameters()} which is defined in
module_utils.c.  Call it at the beginning of the thread code.
@end deffn

@deffn {Output module function}  {int module_stop} (void)
@findex module_stop()

This function should stop the synthesis of the currently spoken message
immediately and throw away the rest of the message.

This function should return immediately.  Speech Dispatcher will
not send another command until module_report_event_stop() is called.
Note that you cannot call module_report_event_stop() from within
the call to module_stop().  The best thing to do is emit
the stop event from another thread.

It should return 0 on success, -1 otherwise.
@end deffn

@deffn {Output module function}  {size_t module_pause} (void)
@findex module_pause()

This function should stop speaking on the synthesizer (or sending
data to soundcard) just after sending an @code{__spd_} index
mark so that Speech Dispatcher knows the position of stop.

The pause can wait for a short time until
an index mark is reached. However, if it's not possible to determine
the exact position, this function should have the same effect
as @code{module_stop}.

This function should return immediately.  Speech Dispatcher will
not send another command until module_report_event_pause() is called.
Note that you cannot call module_report_event_pause() from within
the call to module_pause().  The best thing to do is emit
the pause event from another thread.

For some software synthesizers, the desired effect can be archieved in this way:
When @code{module_speak()} is called, you execute a separate
process and pass it the requested message. This process
cuts the message into sentences and then runs in a loop
and sends the pieces to synthesis. If a signal arrives
from @code{module_pause()}, you set a flag and stop the loop
at the point where next piece of text would be synthesized.

It's not an error if this function is called when the device
is not speaking. In this case, it should return 0.

Note there is no module_resume() function.  The semantics of
@code{module_pause()} is the same as @code{module_stop()} except that
your module should stop after reaching a @code{__spd_} index mark.
Just like @code{module_stop()}, it should discard the rest of the
message after pausing.  On the next @code{module_speak()} call,
Speech Dispatcher will resend the rest of the message after the
index mark.

@subsection Module Utils Functions and Macros

This section describes the various variables, functions and macros
that are available in the @file{module_utils.h} file. They are
intended to make writing new output modules easier and allow the
programmer to reuse existing pieces of code instead of writing
everything from scratch.

@node Initialization Macros and Functions, Generic Macros and Functions, Module Utils Functions and Macros, Module Utils Functions and Macros
@subsubsection Initialization Macros and Functions

@deffn {Module Utils macro} INIT_SETTINGS_TABLES ()
@findex INIT_SETTINGS_TABLES
This macro initializes the settings tables where the parameters
received with the @code{SET} command are stored. You must call
this macro if you want to use the @code{UPDATE_PARAMETER()}
and @code{UPDATE_STRING_PARAMETER()} macros.

It is intended to be called from inside a function just
after the output module starts.
@end deffn

@subsubsection Debugging Macros
@deffn {Module Utils macro} DBG (format, ...)
@findex DBG
DBG() outputs a debugging message, if the @code{Debug} option in module's
configuration is set, to the file specified in configuration ad
@code{DebugFile}. The parameter syntax is the same as for the printf()
function. In fact, it calls printf() internally.
@end deffn

@deffn {Module Utils macro} FATAL (text)
@findex FATAL
Outputs a message specified as @code{text} and calls exit() with
the value EXIT_FAILURE. This terminates the whole output module
without trying to kill the child processes or freeing other
resources other than those that will be freed by the system.

It is intended to be used after some severe error has occurred.
@end deffn

@node Generic Macros and Functions, Functions used by module_main.c, Initialization Macros and Functions, Module Utils Functions and Macros
@subsubsection Generic Macros and Functions

@deffn {Module Utils macro} UPDATE_PARAMETER (param, setter)
@findex UPDATE_PARAMETER
Tests if the integer or enum parameter specified in @code{param}
(e.g. rate, pitch, cap_let_recogn, ...) changed since the
last time when the @code{setter} function was called.

If it changed, it calls the function @code{setter} with the
new value. (The new value is stored in the msg_settings
structure that is created by module_utils.h, which
you normally don't have to care about.)

The function @code{setter} should be defined as:
@example
void setter_name(type value);
@end example

Please look at the @code{SET} command in the communication protocol
for the list of all available parameters.
@pxref{Communication Protocol for Output Modules}.

An example from Festival output module:
@verbatim
static void
festival_set_rate(signed int rate)
{
    assert(rate >= -100 && rate <= +100);
    festivalSetRate(festival_info, rate);
}
[...]
int
module_speak(char *data, size_t bytes, EMessageType msgtype)
{
    [...]
    UPDATE_PARAMETER(rate, festival_set_rate);
    UPDATE_PARAMETER(pitch, festival_set_pitch);
    [...]
}
@end verbatim
@end deffn

@deffn {Module Utils macro} UPDATE_STRING_PARAMETER (param, setter)
@findex  UPDATE_STRING_PARAMETER
The same as @code{UPDATE_PARAMETER} except that it works for
parameters with a string value.
@end deffn

@node Functions used by module_main.c, Functions for use when talking to synthesizer, Generic Macros and Functions, Module Utils Functions and Macros
@subsubsection Functions used by @file{module_main.c}

@deffn {Module Utils function} char* do_speak(void)
@findex do_speak
Takes care of communication after the @code{SPEAK} command was
received. Calls @code{module_speak()} when the full text is received.

It returns a response according to the communication protocol.
@end deffn

@deffn {Module Utils function} char* do_stop(void)
@findex do_stop
Calls the @code{module_stop()} function of the particular
output module.

It returns a response according to the communication protocol.
@end deffn

@deffn {Module Utils function} char* do_pause(void)
@findex do_pause
Calls the @code{module_pause()} function of the particular
output module.

It returns a response according to the communication protocol
and the value returned by @code{module_pause()}.
@end deffn

@deffn {Module Utils function} char* do_set()
@findex do_set
Takes care of communication after the @code{SET} command was
received. Doesn't call any particular function of the output module,
only sets the values in the settings tables. (You should then call the
@code{UPDATE_PARAMETER()} macro in module_speak() to actually set the
synthesizer to these values.)

It returns a response according to the communication protocol.
@end deffn

@deffn {Module Utils function} char* do_speaking()
@findex do_speaking
Calls the @code{module_speaking()} function.

It returns a response according to the communication protocol
and the value returned by @code{module_speaking()}.
@end deffn

@deffn {Module Utils function} void do_quit()
@findex do_quit
Prints the farewell message to the standard output, according
to the protocol. Then it calls @code{module_close()}.
@end deffn

@node Functions for use when talking to synthesizer, Multi-process output modules, Functions used by module_main.c, Module Utils Functions and Macros
@subsubsection Functions for use when talking to synthesizer

@deffn {Module Utils function} static int module_get_message_part ( const char* message, char* part, unsigned int *pos, size_t maxlen, const char* dividers)
@findex  module_get_message_part

Gets a part of the @code{message} according to the specified @code{dividers}.

It scans the text in @code{message} from the byte specified by
@code{*pos} and looks for one of the characters specified in
@code{dividers} followed by a whitespace character or the
terminating NULL byte. If one of them is encountered, the read text is
stored in @code{part} and the number of bytes read is
returned. If end of @code{message} is reached, the return value is
-1.

@code{message} is the text to process. It must be a NULL-terminated
uni-byte string.

@code{part} is a pointer to the place where the output text should
be stored. It must contain at least @code{maxlen} bytes of space.

@code{maxlen} is the maximum number of bytes that should be written
to @code{part}.

@code{dividers} is a NULL-terminated uni-byte string containing
the punctuation characters where the message should be divided
into smaller parts (if they are followed by whitespace).

After returning, @code{pos} is the position
where the function terminated in processing @code{message}.
@end deffn

@deffn {Output module function} void module_report_index_mark(char *mark)
@findex module_report_index_mark
@end deffn
@deffn {Output module function} void module_report_event_*()
@findex module_report_event_*

The @code{module_report_} functions serve for reporting event
notifications and index marking events. You should use them whenever
you get an event from the synthesizer which is defined in the output
module communication protocol.

Note that you cannot call these functions from within a call
to module_speak(), module_stop(), or module_pause().  The best
way to do this is to emit the events from another thread.

@end deffn

@deffn {Output module function} int module_close(void)
@findex module_close

This function is called when Speech Dispatcher terminates.  The output
module should terminate all threads and processes, free all resources,
close all sockets etc.  Never assume this function is called only when
Speech Dispatcher terminates and exit(0) will do the work for you.  It's
perfectly ok for Speech Dispatcher to load, unload or reload output modules
in the middle of its run.

@end deffn

@node Multi-process output modules, Memory Handling Functions, Functions for use when talking to synthesizer, Module Utils Functions and Macros
@subsubsection Multi-process output modules

@deffn {Module Utils function} size_t module_parent_wfork ( TModuleDoublePipe dpipe,
const char* message, SPDMessageType msgtype, const size_t maxlen,
const char* dividers, int *pause_requested)
@findex module_parent_wfork

It simply sends the data to the
child in smaller pieces and waits for confirmation with a single
@code{C} character on the pipe from child to parent.

@code{dpipe} is a parameter which contains the information
necessary for communicating through pipes between the parent and the
child and vice-versa.

@example
typedef struct@{
    int pc[2];            /* Parent to child pipe */
    int cp[2];            /* Child to parent pipe */
@}TModuleDoublePipe;
@end example

@code{message} is a pointer to a NULL-terminated string containing the message
for synthesis.

@code{msgtype} is  the type of the message for synthesis.

@code{maxlen} is the maximum number of bytes that should be transfered
over the pipe.

@code{dividers} is a NULL-terminated string containing the punctuation characters
at which this function should divide the message into smaller pieces.

@code{pause_requested} is a pointer to an integer flag, which is either 0 if
no pause request is pending, or 1 if the function should terminate
at a convenient place in the message because a pause is requested.

In the beginning, it initializes the pipes and then it enters a simple cycle:
@enumerate
@item
Reads a part of the message or an index mark using
@code{module_get_message_part()}.
@item
Looks if there isn't a pending request for pause and handles
it.
@item
Sends the current part of the message to the child
using @code{module_parent_dp_write()}.
@item
Waits until a single character @code{C} comes from the other pipe
using @code{module_parent_dp_read()}.
@item
Repeats the cycle or terminates, if there is no more data.
@end enumerate
@end deffn

@deffn {Module Utils function} int module_parent_wait_continue(TModuleDoublePipe dpipe)
@findex module_parent_wait_continue
Waits until the character @code{C} (continue) is read from the pipe from child.
This function is intended to be run from the parent.

@code{dpipe} is the double pipe used for communication between the child and parent.

Returns 0 if the character was read or 1 if the pipe was broken before the
character could be read.
@end deffn

@deffn {Module Utils function} void module_parent_dp_init (TModuleDoublePipe dpipe)
@findex module_parent_dp_init
Initializes pipes (dpipe) in the parent. Currently it only closes the unnecessary ends.
@end deffn

@deffn {Module Utils function} void module_child_dp_close (TModuleDoublePipe dpipe)
@findex module_child_dp_init
Initializes pipes (dpipe) in the child. Currently it only closes the unnecessary ends.
@end deffn

@deffn {Module Utils function} void module_child_dp_write(TModuleDoublePipe dpipe,  const char *msg, size_t bytes)
@findex module_child_dp_write
Writes the specified number of @code{bytes} from @code{msg} to the pipe to the
parent. This function is intended, as the prefix says, to be run from the child.
Uses the pipes defined in @code{dpipe}.
@end deffn

@deffn {Module Utils function} void module_parent_dp_write(TModuleDoublePipe dpipe,  const char *msg, size_t bytes)

This function is intended, as the prefix says, to be run from the child.
Uses the pipes defined in @code{dpipe}.
@end deffn

@deffn {Module Utils function} int module_parent_dp_read(TModuleDoublePipe dpipe,  char *msg, size_t maxlen)

This function is intended, as the prefix says, to be run from the parent.
Uses the pipes defined in @code{dpipe}.
@end deffn

@deffn {Module Utils function} void module_sigblockall(void)
@findex module_sigblockall
Blocks all signals. This is intended to be run from the child processes

@node Index Marks in Output Modules,  , Module Utils Functions and Macros, Output Modules
@subsection Index Marks in Output Modules

Output modules need to provide some kind of synchronization and they have to
give Speech Dispatcher back some information about what part of the message
is currently being said. On the other hand, output modules are not able to tell
the exact position in the text because various conversions and message processing take place
(sometimes punctuation and spelling substitution, the message needs to be
recoded from multibyte to unibyte coding etc.) before the text reaches
the synthesizer.

For this reason, Speech Dispatcher places so-called index marks in
the text it sends to its output modules. They have the form:

@example
<mark name="id"/>
@end example

@code{id} is the identifier associated with each index
mark. Within a @code{module_speak()} message, each identifer is unique.
It consists of the string @code{__spd_} and a counter number.  Numbers
begin from zero for each message.  For example, the fourth index mark
within a message looks like

@example
<mark name="__spd_id_3"/>
@end example

When an index mark is reached, its identifier should be stored
so that the output module is able to tell Speech Dispatcher the identifier
of the last index mark. Also, index marks are the best place to stop
when the module is requested to pause (although it's ok to stop at
some place close by and report the last index mark).

Notice that index marks are in SSML format using the @code{mark} tag.

You can download Speech Dispatcher's latest release source code from
@uref{http://www.freebsoft.org/speechd}. There is also information
on how to set up anonymous access to our git repository.

However, you may prefer to download Speech Dispatcher in a binary
package for your system. We don't distribute such packages ourselves.
If you run Debian GNU/Linux, it should be in the central repository
under the name @code{speech-dispatcher} or @code{speechd}. If you run
an rpm-based distribution like RedHat, Mandrake or SuSE Linux, please
try to look at @uref{http://www.rpmfind.net/}.

@node Reporting Bugs, How You Can Help, Download and Contact, Top
@chapter Reporting Bugs

If you believe you found a bug in Speech Dispatcher, we will be very
grateful if you let us know about it. Please do it by email on the
address @email{speechd@@bugs.freebsoft.org}, but please don't send us
messages larger than half a megabyte unless we ask you.

To report a bug in a way that is useful for the developers is not
as easy as it may seem. Here are some hints that you should follow in
order to give us the best information so that we can find and fix
the bug easily.

First of all, please try to describe the problem as exactly as you
can. We prefer raw data over speculations about where the problem may
lie. Please try to explain in what situation the bug happens. Even
if it's a general bug that happens in many situations, please try to
describe at least one case in as much detail, as possible.

Also, please specify the versions of programs that you use when
the bug happens. This is not only Speech Dispatcher, but also
the client application you use (speechd-el, say, etc.) and
the synthesizer name and version.

If you can reproduce the bug, please send us the log file also.  This
is very useful, because otherwise, we may not be able to reproduce the
bug with our configuration and program versions that differ from
yours. Configuration must be set to logging priority at least 4, but
best 5, so that it's useful for debugging purposes. You can do so in
@file{etc/speech-dispatcher/speechd.conf} by modifying the variable
@code{LogLevel}. Also, you may want to modify the log destination with
variable @code{LogFile}. After modifying these options, please restart
Speech Dispatcher and repeat the situation in which the bug
happens. After it happened, please take the log and attach it to the
bug report, preferably compressed using @code{gzip}. But note, that
when logging with level 5, all the data that come from Speech Dispatcher
is also recorded, so make sure there is no sensitive information
when you are reproducing the bug. Please make sure you switch back
to priority 3 or lower logging, because priority 4 or 5 produces
really huge logs.

If you are a programmer and you find a bug that is reproducible in
SSIP, you can send us the sequence of SSIP commands that lead to the
bug (preferably from starting the connection). You can also try to
reproduce the bug in a simple test-script under
@file{speech-dispatcher/src/tests} in the source tree. Please check
@file{speech-dispatcher/src/tests/README} and see the other tests
scripts there for an example.

When the bug is a SEGMENTATION FAULT, a backtrace from gdb is also
valuable, but if you are not familiar with gdb, don't bother with
that, we may ask you to do it later.

Finally, you may also send us a guess of what you think
happens in Speech Dispatcher that causes the bug, but this is
usually not very helpful. If you are able to provide additional technical
information instead, please do so.

@node How You Can Help, Appendices, Reporting Bugs, Top
@chapter How You Can Help

If you want to contribute to the development of Speech Dispatcher,
we will be very happy if you do so. Please contact us on
@email{users@@lists.freebsoft.org}.

Here is a short, definitively not exhaustive, list of how you can
help us and other users.

@itemize
@item
@emph{Donate money:} We are a non-profit organization and we can't work without
funding. Brailcom, o.p.s. created Speech Dispatcher, speechd-el and also works
on other projects to help blind and visually impaired users of computers. We build
on Free Software and GNU/Linux, because we believe this is the right way. But it
won't be possible when we have no money. @uref{http://www.freebsoft.org/}

@item
@emph{Report bugs:} Every user, even if he can't give us money and he is not
a programmer, can help us very much by just using our software and telling
us about the bugs and inconveniences he encounters. A good user community that
reports bugs is a crucial part of development of a good Free Software package.
We can't test our software under all circumstances and on all platforms, so each
constructive bug report is highly appreciated. You can report bugs in Speech
Dispatcher on @email{speechd@@bugs.freebsoft.org}.

@item
@emph{Write or modify an application to support synthesis:} With
Speech Dispatcher, we have provided an interface that allows
applications easy access to speech synthesis. However powerful, it's
no more than an interface, and it's useless on its own. Now it's time
to write the particular client applications, or modify existing
applications so that they can support speech synthesis.  It is useful
if the application needs a specific interface for blind people or if
it wants to use speech synthesis for educational or other purposes.

@item
@emph{Develop new voices and language definitions for Festival:} In
the world of Free Software, currently Festival is the most promising
interface for Text-to-Speech processing and speech synthesis. It's
an extensible and highly configurable platform for developing synthetic
voices. If there is a lack of synthetic voices or no voices at all for
some language, we believe the wisest solution is to try to develop
a voice in Festival. It's certainly not advisable to develop your
own synthesizer if the goal is producing a quality voice system
in a reasonable time. Festival developers provide nice documentation
about how to develop a voice and a lot of tools that help doing
this. We found that some language definitions can be constructed
by canibalizing the already existing definitions and can be tuned
later. As for the voice samples, one can temporarily use the
MBROLA project voices. But please note that, although they are
downloadable for free (as price), they are not Free Software
and it would be wonderful if we could replace them by Free Software
alternatives as soon as possible.
See @uref{http://www.cstr.ed.ac.uk/projects/festival/}.

@item
@emph{Help us with this or other Free-b-Soft projects:} Please look at
@uref{http://www.freebsoft.org} to find information about our
projects. There is a plenty of work to be done for the blind and
visually impaired people to make their work with computers easier.

@item
@emph{Spread the word about Speech Dispatcher and Free Software:} You can
help us, and the whole community around Free Software, just by telling
your friends about the amazing world of Free Software. It doesn't
have to be just about Speech Dispatcher; you can tell them about
other projects or about Free Software in general. Remember that
Speech Dispatcher could only arise out of understanding of some people
of the principles and ideas behind Free Software. And this is mostly
the same for the rest of the Free Software world.

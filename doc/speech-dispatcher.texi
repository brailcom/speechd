@cindex Philosophy

Speech Dispatcher project comes to provide a device independent layer for
speech synthesis. It should provide a simple interface for client
applications (applications, that want to speak) as well as for device
driver modules (the different speech synthesisizers).

High quality speech synthesis has been available for a long time and
now it's usable even by ordinary users on their home PC's. It comes
sometimes as a necessity, sometimes as a good feature for programs to
provide speech output.  There is a wide field of possible uses from
educational software, to specialized systems (hospitals,
laboratories).  For visually impaired users it is one of the two
essential ways of getting the output from computer (the second one is
a Braille display). That's also where Speech Dispatcher comes from.

There are different speech synthesizers with different capabilities.
Some of them are hardware, some of them are software.  Some of them
are Free Software and are are available on the Internet.  Programmers
have really hard times when they want to make their program speak
because they need to find some suitable synthesizer (long hours of
experiments and so on...) and then make it work with their program.
They often need to write output device drivers for these programs or
hardware devices and are doing it again and again.  You can imagine it
all fails when an innocent user executes two programs with speech
output at once --- if they even start both (what I doubt), they will
be shouting one over the other.  This makes it very hard for
programmers to implement speech support to their programs (for blind
users or simply to make a better user interface) and it's one of the
reasons we still don't fully exploit what speech synthesis technology
offers.

In an ideal world, programmers could use similar commands for speech
synthesis as they do for normal text output (printf, puts, ...).  In an
ideal world, there would be some speech_printf() that would take care of
saying your message in the right time without interrupting others, without
them being obligated to take care of how exactly the communication with
speech synthesizer is implemented and without them having to worry about
what synthesizer to use and if it's available.  In an ideal world, there
would be some speech synthesizer in each GNU/Linux distribution and some
common interface taking care of all applications that want to speak,
allowing user to configure speech parameters and providing simple interface
(as speech_printf()) through some shared library for programmers.  It will
be a long way until we achieve this state of things, but with Speech
Dispatcher, we are taking the first steps...

@node Basic Design, Features Overview, Motivation, Introduction
@section Design
@cindex Design
        
The communication between all applications and synthesizers is a
great mess. For this purpose, we wanted Speech Dispatcher to be a
layer separating applications and synthesizers so that applications
wouldn't have to care about synthesizers and synthesizers wouldn't
have to care about interaction with applications.

We decided we would implement Speech Dispatcher as a server receiving
commands from applications over a protocol called @code{SSIP},
parsing them and if it's necessary and calling appropriate functions
of output modules communicating with the different synthesizers.
These output modules are implemented as plug-ins, so that the user
can just load a new module if he wants to use new synthesizer.

Each client (application that wants to speak) opens a socket
connection to Speech Dispatcher and calls functions like say(),
stop(), pause() provided by a library implementing the protocol.
This shared library is still on the client side and sends Speech
Dispatcher SSIP commands over the socket. When these arrive
at Speech Dispatcher, it parses them, reads the text that should
be said and put it in a queues according to the priority
of this message and other criteria. It then decides when,
with which parameters (set up by the client and the user)
and on which synthesizer it will say the message. These requests
are handled by the output plug-ins (output modules) for different
hardware and software synthesizers and then said aloud.

@section Features Overview
Speech Dispatcher from user's point of view:

@itemize @bullet
@item easy configuration of different speaking applications, central maintenance
@item the ability to freely choose which synthesizer with which application
@item less time devoted to configuration and tuning different applications and synthesis
@item history of said messages for visually impaired

Speech Dispatcher from application programmers' point of view:

@itemize @bullet

@end itemize

@node Current State,  , Features Overview, Introduction
@section Current State
@cindex Synthesizers
@cindex Other programs

In this version, most of the features of Speech Dispatcher are
implemented and we believe it's now useful for applications as a
device independent Text-to-Speech layer.

Currently, the main application that works with Speech Dispatcher is
speechd-el. This is a client for Emacs, targeted primarily on blind
people. It's similar to Emacspeak, however the two take a bit
different approach and serve different user needs. You can find
speechd-el on @uref{http://www.freebsoft.org/speechd-el/}. This way
Speech Dispatcher can be used to do nearly everything one can do in
GNU/Linux text interface, like editing text, reading email, browsing
web, etc.

We also provide a shared C library, that implements the SSIP functions
of Speech Dispatcher in a higher level interface, so writing client
applications in C should be quite easy. There is currently none,
however, we are looking to implement support into GNU Typist,
a typing tutorial, and maybe others applications.

On the synthesis side, there is a good support for Festival. Festival
is a Free Software multi-language Text-to-Speech and synthesis system, that
is very flexible and extensible using the Scheme scripting
language. Currently, it supports high quality synthesis for several
languages, and on today's computers runs reasonably fast.
See @uref{http://www.cstr.ed.ac.uk/projects/festival/}

For simpler purposes, there is also support for Flite. Flite (Festival
Light) is a lighter Free Software TTS with synthesis intended to run
on systems with limited resources. In this time, it only has one
English voice and porting voices from Festival looks rather difficult.
With the caching mechanism provided by Speech Dispatcher, Festival is
even Faster than Flite in many situations.  See
@uref{http://www.speech.cs.cmu.edu/flite/}

Then Speech Dispatcher offers support for generic output devices,
which means that basically every Text-to-Speech program that provides
a simple command line interface can be run with Speech Dispatcher
after a little bit of tuning in the configuration file. This kind
of output module provides only limited functionality, but it can
be useful if there are no other choices for your language.

We decided not to support the simple hardware devices ourselves,
because they don't support synchronization and therefore have serious
problems when handling multiple messages. On the other hand, we
will be happy if someone other writes output modules for these
devices, because for some users, there is still no other choice.

Currently, there is no application that would serve as a managing
center for Speech Dispatcher. We think of this application as a client
of Speech Dispatcher, where a user can modify all the parameters of
the other connections, browse history, modify settings in permanent
text file configuration and so on. We welcome anyone who would like to
help us with such a client.

@subsection Multiple Output Modules
@cindex output module
@cindex different synthesizers

Speech Dispatcher supports concurrent use of multiple output modules.  In the
case these output modules provide good synchronization, you can combine them in
reading messages.  For example if module1 can speak English and Czech while
module2 speaks only German, the idea is that if there is some message in
German, module2 is used, while module1 is used for the other languages.
However the language is not the only criteria for the decision.  The rules for
selection of an output module can be influenced through the configuration file
@file{speech-dispatcher/speechd.conf}.

@subsubsection Provided functionality

Please note that some output modules don't support the full Speech
Dispatcher functionality (e.g. spelling mode, sound icons). If there
is no easy way around the missing functionality, we don't try to
emulate it in some complicated way and rather try to encourage the
developers of that particular synthesizer to add that
functionality. We are actively working on adding the missing parts to
Festival, so Festival supports nearly all of the features of Speech
Dispatcher and we encourage you to use it.

@node Supported Modules, Compiling a New Module , Provided Functionality, Multiple Output Modules
@subsubsection Supported Modules

Currently, these output modules are supported: Festival, Flite, Epos
and Generic. 

@itemize

@item Festival
Festival is a Free Software multi-language Text-to-Speech and
synthesis system, that is very flexible and extensible using the
Scheme scripting language. Currently, it supports high quality
synthesis for several languages, and on today's computers it runs
reasonably fast.  If you are not sure which one to use and your
language is supported by Festival, we avise you to use it. See
@uref{http://www.cstr.ed.ac.uk/projects/festival/}

@item Flite 
Flite (Festival Light) is a lighter Free Software TTS with synthesis
intended to run on systems with limited resources. In this time, it
only has one English voice and porting voices from Festival looks
rather difficult.  With the caching mechanism provided by Speech
Dispatcher, Festival is faster than Flite in most situations.  See
@uref{http://www.speech.cs.cmu.edu/flite/}

@item Generic
The Generic module can be used with any synthesizer that can be
managed by a simple command line application. @xref{Configuration of
the Generic Output Module}, for more details about how to use it.
However, it only provides a very rudimentary support of speaking.

@end itemize

@node Compiling a New Module ,  , Supported Modules, Multiple Output Modules
@subsubsection Compiling a New Module 

If you want to compile and use a new output module, you should place
it in @file{src/modules} in your source directory of Speech Dispatcher
and add it to @file{src/modules/Makefile.am}. You can compile and
install it by typing: @code{make; su root; make install}. The last
step you have to do is to let Speech Dispatcher know that you want to
use this new module by adding at least these two lines to
@file{speech-dispatcher/speechd.conf} in your configuration
directory. @xref{AddModule}.

@example
AddModule "module_name" "binary" "configuration"
@end example

and possibly also changing the lines

@example
DefaultModule new_module
@end example

to make it default or

@example
LanguageDefaultModule "en"  "new_module"
@end example

to make it default for some language.

@subsubsection User Authentication
@cindex Identification Protocol
@cindex identd
@cindex RFC 1413

NOTE: This feature is being implemented, however the current version
does not support it.

Speech Dispatcher does not provide any explicit authentication mechanism.  To
check the identity of users, Speech Dispatcher uses the Identification Protocol
mechanism defined by RFC 1413 to get the user's identity. 

@cindex user mapping
It is possible to specify user mapping in the configuration.  This allows
certain users to be considered the same and have the same rights (eg. to browse
their @ref{Top,,Message History,ssip, SSIP Documentation}).

@node Access Rights to Message History,  , User Authentication, Security
@subsubsection Access Rights to Message History
@cindex access rights

To protect privacy of users, Speech Dispatcher restricts history access to a
certain subset of all the received messages.  The following rules apply:

@itemize @bullet
@item
All the messages issued by a client connection are accessible to that
client connection.

@item
All the messages sent by a given user are accessible to that user.

@item
@cindex @code{speechd} user
@cindex @code{speechd} group
All the messages sent by the user @code{speechd} are accessible to all
users on the system running the Speech Dispatcher instance present in the
group @code{speechd}.

@item
No other messages are accessible.
@end itemize

Two users are considered the same, if and only if their connections originate
on the same host, their user names are the same, and their identity can be
checked, as described in @ref{User Authentication}.  If user's identity cannot
be checked, the user is considered different of all other connected or
previously connected users.

@section Invoking

@subsection Necessary Privileges

Speech Dispatcher can generally run under an ordinary user.
We tried to make it as secure as possible, however, we aren't
security experts and the code can contain dangerous bugs. It's
not advisable to run it as root or some other highly privileged
user.

The only restrictions are these:

@itemize
@item
Speech Dispatcher creates a PID file in @file{/var/run/speech-dispatcher.pid}
by default, so @file{/var/run/} must be writable by the user that
runs Speech Dispatcher. This can be overridden by specifying
the @code{pidpath} option when calling the @code{./configure}
script during the compilation process.
@item
When logging is on, the default path to place Speech Dispatcher's
log is @file{/var/log/speech-dispatcher.log}. However, this can be configured
at any time in the main configuration file.
@end itemize

@subsection Command Line Options

Speech Dispatcher can be invoked with these options:

@code{speech-dispatcher [-@{d|s@}] [-l @{1|2|3|4|5@}] [-p=port] | [-v] | [-h]}

@table @code
@item -d or --run-daemon
Run as a deamon (it runs in background, detaches of the current
terminal, etc.)

@item -s or --run-single
Run in single mode (continues as a regular application).

@item -l level or --log-level=level
Specifies the desired log level. Log level is a number between 0 and 5
(0 means don't write log, 5 means write almost everything including
the text being processed). Default is 3. @xref{Log Levels}.

@item -p or --port
Wait for clients on this port. Default is ???.

@item -v or --version
Print information about this version of Speech Dispatcher. It also
reports basic copyright info.

@item -h or --help
Print out help about command line options, copyright message and email
address for sending bug reports.
@end table


@node Configuration,  , Invoking, User's Documentation
@section Configuration
@cindex configuration
@cindex default values

Speech Dispatcher can be configured on several different levels.  You can
configure the global settings through server configuration file.  There is also
a support for per-client configuration.

Further more applications often come with their own means of configuration of
speech related settings.  Please see the documentation of your application for
details about application specific configuration.

@subsection Configuration file syntax

We use the DotConf library to read a permanent text-file based
configuration, so the syntax might be familiar to many users.

Each of the string constants, if not specified differently,
should be encoded in UTF-8. The option names can't use use
other than the standard ASCII charset restricted to characters
(@code{a}, @code{b}), dashes (@code{-}) and underscores @code{_}.

Commentaries and temporarily inactive options begin with @code{#}.
If such an option should be turned on, just remove the comment
character and set it to the desired value.
@example
# this is a comment
# InactiveOption "this option is turned off by the commentary"
@end example

Strings are enclosed in doublequotes.
@example

@subsection Output Modules Configuration

Each user should turn on at least one output module in his
configuration, if he wants Speech Dispatcher to produce
any sound output. If no output module is loaded, Speech Dispatcher
will start, log messages into history and communicate with clients,
but no sound is produced.

Each output module has to be loaded to Speech Dispatcher by an
``AddModule'' line in @file{speech-dispatcher/speechd.conf}. Additionally, each
output module can have associated it's own configuration file.

@subsubsection Loading Modules in speechd.conf

@anchor{AddModule}
Each module that should be run when Speech Dispatcher starts must be loaded
by the @code{AddModule} command in the configuration. Note that you can load
one binary module multiple times under different names with different
configurations. This is especially useful for loading the generic output
module. @xref{Configuration of the Generic Output Module}.

@example
AddModule "@var{module_name}" "@var{module_binary}" "@var{module_config}"
@end example

@var{module_name} is the name of the output module.

@var{module_binary} is the name of the binary executable
of this output module. It can be either absolute or relative
to @file{bin/speechd-modules/}.

@var{module_config} is the file where the configuration for
this output module is stored. It can be either absolute or relative
to @file{etc/speech-dispatcher/modules/}. This parameter is optional.

@node Configuration files of output modules, Configuration of the Generic Output Module, Loading Modules in speechd.conf, Output Modules Configuration
@subsubsection Configuration Files of Output Modules

Each output module is different and therefore has a different
configuration options. Please look at the comments in it's
configuration file for detailed description. However, there
are several options which are common for some
output modules. Here is a short overview of them.

@table @code
@item AddVoice "@var{language}" "@var{symbolicname}" "@var{name}"
@anchor{AddVoice}

Each output module provides some voices and sometimes it even supports
different languages. For this reason, there is a common mechanism how
these can be defined in configuration, although, no module is
obligated to use it. Some synthesizers, e.g. Festival, support the
SSIP symbolic names directly, so the particular configuration of these
zvoices is done in the synthesizer itself.

For each voice, there is exactly one @code{AddVoice} line.

@var{language} is the ISO language code of the language of this voice.

@var{symbolicname} is a symbolic name under which you wish this voice
to be available. See @ref{Top,,Standard Voices, ssip, SSIP
Documentation} for the list of names you can use.

@var{name} is a name specific for the given output module. Please see
the comments in the configuration file under the appropriate AddModule
section for more info.

For example our current definition of voices for Epos looks
like this:

@example
        AddVoice        "cs"  "male1"   "kadlec"
        AddVoice        "sk"  "male1"   "bob"
@end example

@item ModuleDelimiters "@var{delimiters}", ModuleMaxChunkLength @var{length}

Normally, the output module doesn't try to synthesize all 
incoming text at once, but instead it cuts it into smaller
chunks (sentences, parts of sentences) and then synthesizes
them one by one. This second approach, used by some output
modules, is much faster, however it limits the ability of
the output module to provide good intonation.

For this reason, you can configure at which characters
(@var{delimiters}) the text should be cut in smaller blocks
or after how much characters (@var{length}) it should be cut,
if there is no @var{delimiter} found.

Making the two rules more strict, you will get better speed
but give away some quality of intonation. So for example
for slower computers, we recommend to include coma (,)
in @var{delimiters} so that the text is cut in parts
of sentences, while for faster computers, it's preferable
not to include coma and synthesize the whole composed
sentences.

The same applies to @code{MaxChunkLength}, it's better
to set higher value for faster computers.

For example, curently the default for Festival is

@example
    FestivalMaxChunkLength  300
    FestivalDelimiters  ".?!;,"
@end example

The output module may also decide to cut sentences on delimiters
only if they are followed by a space. This way for example
``file123.tmp'' would not be cut in two parts, but ``The horse
raced around the fence, that was lately painted green, fell.''
would be. (This is an interesting sentence, by the way.)
@end table

@node Configuration of the Generic Output Module,  , Configuration files of output modules, Output Modules Configuration
@subsubsection Configuration files of the Generic Output Module

The generic output module allows you to easily write your
own simple output module for synthesizers that have a simple
command line interface only by modifying the configuration
file. This way, no specific code is needed to write in C
and users can add support for their device even if they don't
know how to program. @xref{AddModule}.

The core part of a generic output module is the command
execution line.

@defvr {Generic Module Configuration} GenericExecuteSynth "@var{execution_string}"

@code{execution_string} is the command that should be executed
in shell when it's desired to say something. In fact, it can
be more commands concatenated by the @code{&&} operator. To stop
saying the message, the output module will send a KILL signal to
this process group, so it's important that it immediately
stoped speaking after the processes are killed. (On most GNU/Linux
system, the @code{play} utility has this property).

In the execution string, you can use the following variables,
that will be substituted by the desired values before executing
the command.

@itemize
@item @code{$DATA}
The text data that should be said. The string's characters that would interfere
with bash processing are already escaped. However, it may be needed to put
double quotes around it (like this: @code{\"$DATA\"}).
@item @code{$LANG}
The language identification string (it's defined by GenericLanguage).
@item @code{$VOICE}
The voice identification string (it's defined by AddVoice).
@item @code{$PITCH}
The desired pitch (a float number defined in GenericPitchAdd and GenericPitchMultiply).
@item @code{$RATE}
The desired rate or speed (a float number defined in GenericRateAdd and GenericRateMultiply)
@end itemize

Here is an example from @file{etc/speech-dispatcher/modules/epos-generic.conf}
@example
GenericExecuteSynth \
"epos-say -o --language $LANG --voice $VOICE --init_f $PITCH --init_t $RATE \
\"$DATA\" | sed -e s+unknown.*$++ >/tmp/epos-said.wav && play /tmp/epos-said.wav >/dev/null"
@end example
@end defvr

@defvr {GenericModuleConfiguration} AddVoice "@var{language}" "@var{symbolicname}" "@var{name}"
@xref{AddVoice}.
@end defvr

@defvr {GenericModuleConfiguration} GenericLanguage "iso-code" "string-subst"

Defines which string @code{string-subst} should be substituted for @code{$LANG}
for a given @code{iso-code} language code.

Another example from Epos generic:
@example
GenericLanguage "en" "english"
GenericLanguage "cs" "czech"
GenericLanguage "sk" "slovak"
@end example
@end defvr

@defvr {GenericModuleConfiguration} GenericRateAdd @var{num}
@end defvr
@defvr {GenericModuleConfiguration} GenericRateMultiply @var{num}
@end defvr
@defvr {GenericModuleConfiguration} GenericPitchAdd @var{num}
@end defvr
@defvr {GenericModuleConfiguration} GenericPitchMultiply @var{num}
These parameters set rate and pitch conversion to compute
the value of @code{$RATE} and @code{$PITCH}. 

The resulting rate (or pitch) is calculated using the following formula:
@example
   (speechd_rate * GenericRateMultiply) + GenericRateAdd
@end example
while speechd_rate is a value between -100 (lowest) and +100 (highest)
Some meaningful conversion for the specific text-to-speech system
used must by defined.

(The values in GenericSthMultiply are multiplied by 100, because
DotConf currently doesn't support floats. So you can write 0.85 as 85 and
so on.)

Clients communicate with Speech Dispatcher via the Speech Synthesis
Internet Protocol (SSIP) @xref{Top, , , ssip, Speech Synthesis
Internet Protocol documentation}.  The protocol is the actual
interface to Speech Dispatcher.

Usually you don't need to use SSIP directly.  You can use one of the
programming interfaces wrapping SSIP with programming library calls.  This is a
recommended way of communication with Speech Dispatcher.  We try so support as
many programming environments as possible.  This manual (except SSIP) contains
documentation for C and Python interface, however there are also other
interfaces developed as external projects.  Please contact us for information
about current external client libraries.

@deffn {C API function} SPDConnection* spd_open(char* client_name, char* connection_name, char* user_name,
                                       SPDConnectionMode connection_mode)
@findex spd_open()

Opens a new connection to Speech Dispatcher and returns a socket file descriptor you will
use to communicate with Speech Dispatcher. It's one of the parameter of all the others
functions. It reads Speech Dispatcher's port number from the environment variable
@var{SPEECHD_PORT}.

The three parameters @code{client_name}, @code{connection_name} and @code{username}
are there only for informational and navigational purpose, they don't affect
any settings or behavior of any functions. The authentication mechanism
has nothing to do with @code{username}. These parameters are important for
the user when he wants to set some parameters for a given session, when he
wants to browse through history, etc. The parameter @code{connection_mode}
specifies how this connection should be handled internally and if events
notifications and index marking capabilities will be available.

@code{client_name} is the name of the client that opens the connection. Normally,
it should be the name of the executable, for example ``lynx'', ``emacs'', ``bash'',
or ``gcc''. It can't be left to NULL.

@code{connection_name} determines the particular use of that connection. If you
use only one connection in your program, this should be set to ``main'' (passing
a NULL pointer has the same effect). If you use two or more connections in
your program, their @code{client_name}s should be the same, but @code{connection_name}s
should differ. For example: ``buffer'', ``command_line'', ``text'', ``menu''.

@code{username} should be set to the name of the user. Normally, you should
get this string from the system. If set to NULL, libspeechd will try to
determine it automatically by g_get_user_name().

@code{connection_mode} has two possible values: @code{SPD_MODE_SINGLE}
and @code{SPD_MODE_THREADED}. If the parameter is set to
@code{SPD_MODE_THREADED}, then @code{spd_open()} will open an
additional thread in your program which will handle asynchronous SSIP
replies and will allow you to use callbacks for events notification
and index marking, allowing you to keep track of the progress of
timing of speaking the messages. However, you must be avare, that your
program is now multi-threaded and care must be taken when
using/handling signals. If @code{SPD_MODE_SINGLE} is chosen, the
library won't execute any additional threads and SSIP will run only as
a synchronous protocol, therefore events notifications and index
marking won't be available.

It returns a newly allocated SPDConnection* structure on success, or @code{NULL}
on error.

Each connection you open should be closed by spd_close() before the
end of the program, so that the associated connection descriptor is
closed, threads are terminated and memmory is freed.

@end deffn

@deffn {C API function}  void spd_close(SPDConnection *connection)
@findex spd_close()

Closes a Speech Dispatcher socket connection, terminates associated
threads (if necessary) and frees the memmory allocated by
spd_open(). You should close every connection before the end of your
program.

@code{connection} is the SPDConnection connection obtained by spd_open().

@subsection Speech Synthesis Commands

@defvar {C API type} SPDPriority
@vindex SPDPriority

@code{SPDPriority} is an enum type that represents the possible priorities that
can be assigned to a message.

@example
typedef enum@{
    SPD_IMPORTANT = 1,
    SPD_MESSAGE = 2,
    SPD_TEXT = 3,
    SPD_NOTIFICATION = 4,
    SPD_PROGRESS = 5
@}SPDPriority;
@end example

@xref{Top,,Message Priority Model,ssip, SSIP Documentation}.

@end defvar

@deffn {C API function}  int spd_say(SPDConnection* connection, SPDPriority priority, char* text);
@findex spd_say()

Sends a message to Speech Dispatcher. If this message isn't blocked by some message
of higher priority and this CONNECTION isn't paused, it will be synthesized
directly on some of the output devices. Otherwise, the message will be discarded
or delayed according to it's priority.

@code{connection} is the SPDConnection* connection created by spd_open().

@code{priority} is the desired priority for this message. @xref{Top,,Message Priority Model,ssip, SSIP Documentation}.

@code{text} is a null terminated string containing text you want to sent to
synthesis. It must be encoded in UTF-8. Note that this doesn't have to be what
you will finally hear. It can be affected by different settings as spelling,
punctuation, text substitution etc.

It returns a positive unique message identification number on success, -1 otherwise.
This message identification number can be saved and used for the purposes of
events notification callbacks or history handling.

@end deffn

@deffn {C API function}  int spd_sayf(SPDConnection* connection, SPDPriority priority, char* format, ...);
@findex spd_sayf()

Similar to @code{spd_say()}, simulates the behavior of printf().

@code{format} is a string containing text and format of the parameters, like ``%d'',
``%s'' etc. It must be encoded in UTF-8.

@code{...} is an arbitrary number of arguments.

All other parameters are the same as for spd_say().

For example:
@example
       spd_sayf(conn, SPD_TEXT, "Hello %s, how are you?", username);
       spd_sayf(conn, SPD_IMPORTANT, "Fatal error on [%s:%d]", filename, line);
@end example

But be careful with unicode! For example this doesn't work:

@example
       spd_sayf(conn, SPD_NOTIFY, ``Pressed key is %c.'', key);
@end example

Why? Because you are supposing that key is a char, but that will
fail with languages using amplified charsets. The proper solution
is:

@example
       spd_sayf(conn, SPD_NOTIFY, ``Pressed key is %s'', key);
@end example
where key is a encoded string.

It returns a positive unique message identification number on success, -1 otherwise.
This message identification number can be saved and used for the purposes of
events notification callbacks or history handling.

@subsection Speech Output Control Commands

@subsubheading Stop Commands

@deffn {C API function}  int spd_stop(SPDConnection* connection);
@findex spd_stop()

Stops the message currently being spoken on a given connection. If there
is no message being spoken, does nothing. (It doesn't touch the messages
waiting in queues). This is intended for stops executed by the user,
not for automatic stops (because automatically, you can't control
how many messages are still waiting in queues on the server).

It returns 0 on succes, -1 otherwise.
@end deffn

@deffn {C API function}  int spd_stop_all(SPDConnection* connection);
@findex spd_stop_all()

The same as spd_stop(), but it stops every message being said,
without distinguishing where it came from.

It returns 0 on succes, -1 if some of the stops failed.
@end deffn

@deffn {C API function}  int spd_stop_uid(SPDConnection* connection, int target_uid);
@findex spd_stop_uid()

The same as spd_stop() except that it stops some other client than
the calling one. You must specify this client in @code{target_uid}.

@code{target_uid} is the unique ID of the connection you want
to execute stop() on. It can be obtained from spd_history_get_client_list().
@xref{History Commands in C}.

It returns 0 on succes, -1 otherwise.

@end deffn

@subsubheading Cancel Commands

@deffn {C API function}  int spd_cancel(SPDConnection* connection);

to do, when you call spd_cancel() automatically in
your program.
@end deffn

@deffn {C API function}  int spd_cancel_all(SPDConnection* connection);

@subsubheading Pause Commands

@deffn {C API function}  int spd_pause(SPDConnection* connection);
@findex int spd_pause()

Pauses all messages received from the given connection. No messages
except for priority @code{notification} and @code{progress} all thrown
away, they are all waiting in a separate queue for resume(). The
message that was being said in the moment pause() was received will be
continued from the place where it was paused.

It returns immediately. However, that doesn't mean that the speech
output must be stopped immediately. Instead, it can continue speaking
the message for a while until a place where the position in the text
can be determined exactly is reached. This is necessary to be able to
provide `resume' without gaps and overlapping.

When pause is on for the given client, all newly received
messages are also queued and waiting for resume().

It returns 0 on succes, -1 if something failed.
@end deffn

@deffn {C API function}  int spd_pause_all(SPDConnection* connection);

@node Events Notification and Index Marking in C, History Commands in C, Information Retrieval Commands in C, C API
@subsection Events Notification and Index Marking in C

When the SSIP connection is run in asynchronous mode , it is possible
to register callbacks for all the SSIP events notifications and index
marks notifications, as defined in @ref{Message Events Notification
and Index Marking,,, ssip, SSIP Documentation}

@defvar {C API type} SPDNotification
@vindex SPDNotification
@anchor{SPDNotification}

@code{SPDNotification} is an enum type that represents the possible
base notification types that can be assigned to a message.

@example
typedef enum@{
    SPD_BEGIN = 1,
    SPD_END = 2,
    SPD_INDEX_MARKS = 4,
    SPD_CANCEL = 8,
    SPD_PAUSE = 16,
    SPD_RESUME = 32
@}SPDNotification;
@end example
@end defvar

There are currently two types of callbacks in the C API.

@defvar {C API type} SPDCallback
@vindex SPDCallback
@anchor{SPDCallback}
@code{void (*SPDCallback)(size_t msg_id, size_t client_id, SPDNotificationType state);}

This one is used for notifications about the events: @code{BEGIN}, @code{END}, @code{PAUSE}
and @code{RESUME}. When the callback is called, it obtains three parameters of the event.

@code{msg_id} unique identification number of the message the notification is about.

@code{client_id} specifies the unique identification number of the client who sent the
message. This is usually the same connection as the connection which registers this
callback, and therefore uninteresting. However, in some special cases it might be useful
to register this callback for other SSIP connections, or register the same callback for
several connections originating at the same application.

@code{state} is the @code{SPD_Notification} type of this notification. @xref{SPDNotification}.
@end defvar

@defvar {C API type} SPDCallbackIM
@vindex SPDCallbackIM
@code{void (*SPDCallbackIM)(size_t msg_id, size_t client_id, SPDNotificationType state,
char *index_mark);}

@code{SPDCallbackIM} is used for notifications about reached index marks in the message.
(A way to specify index marks is e.g. through the SSML element <mark/> in ssml mode.)

The syntax and meaning of these parameters are the same as for @ref{SPDCallback}
except for the additional parameter @code{index_mark}.

@code{index_mark} is a NULL terminated string associated with the index mark. Please
note that this string is specified by client application and therefore it needn't be
unique.
@end defvar

One or more callbacks can be supplied for a given @code{SPDConnection*} connection by
assigning the values of pointers to the appropriate functions to the following connection
members:

@example
    SPDCallback callback_begin;
    SPDCallback callback_end;
    SPDCallback callback_cancel;
    SPDCallback callback_pause;
    SPDCallback callback_resume;
    SPDCallbackIM callback_im;
@end example

There are three settings commands which will turn notifications on and
off for the current SSIP connection and cause the callbacks to be called
when the event is registered by Speech Dispatcher.

@deffn {C API function} int spd_set_notification_on(SPDConnection* connection, SPDNotification notification);
@findex spd_set_notification_on
@end deffn
@deffn {C API function} int spd_set_notification_off(SPDConnection* connection, SPDNotification notification);
@findex spd_set_notification_off
@end deffn
@deffn {C API function} int spd_set_notification(SPDConnection* connection, SPDNotification notification, const char* state);
@findex spd_set_notification

These functions will set the notification specified by the parameter
@code{notification} on or off (or to the given value)
respectively. Note that it is only safe to call these functions after
the appropriate callback functions were set in the @code{SPDCallback}
structure. Doing otherwise is not considered an error, but the
application might miss some events due to callback functions not being
executed (e.g. the client might receive an @code{END} event without
receiving the corresponding @code{BEGIN} event in advance.

@code{connection} is the SPDConnection* connection created by spd_open().

@code{notification} is the requested type of notifications that should be reported by SSIP. @xref{SPDNotification}.
Note that also '|' combinations are possible, as illustrated in the bellow example.

@code{state} must be either the string ``on'' or ``off'', for switching the given notification on or off.

@end deffn

The following example shows how to use callbacks for the simple
purpose of playing a message and waiting until it's end. (Please note
that checks of return values in this example as well as other code
not directly related to index marking, have been removed for the purpose
of clarity.)

@example
#include <semaphore.h>

sem_t semaphore;

/* Callback for Speech Dispatcher notifications */
void end_of_speech(size_t msg_id, size_t client_id, SPDNotificationType type)
@{
   /* We don't check msg_id here since we will only send one
       message */

   /* Callbacks are running in a separate thread, so lets the
       (sleeping) main thread know about the event and wake it up */
   sem_post(&semaphore);
@}

int
main(int argc, char **argv)
@{
   SPDConnection *conn;

   sem_init(&semaphore, 0, 0);

   /* Open Speech Dispatcher connection in THREADED mode */ 
   conn = spd_open("say","main", NULL, SPD_MODE_THREADED);

   /* Set callback handler for 'end' and 'cancel' events */ 
   conn->callback_end = con->callback_cancel = end_of_speech;

   /* Ask Speech Dispatcher to notify us about these events */ 
   spd_set_notification_on(conn, SPD_END);
   spd_set_notification_on(conn, SPD_CANCEL);

   /* Say our message */
   spd_sayf(conn, SPD_MESSAGE, (char*) argv[1]);

   /* Wait for 'end' or 'cancel' of the sent message. 
      By SSIP specifications, we are guaranteed to get
      one of these two eventually. */ 
   sem_wait(&semaphore);

   return 0;

It might happen that you want to use some SSIP function that is not
available through this library or you may want to use an available
function in a different manner. (If you think there is something
missing in this library or you have some useful comment on the
available functions, please let us know.) For this purpose, there are
a few functions that will allow you to send arbitrary SSIP commands on
your connection and read the replies.

@deffn {C API function} int spd_execute_command(SPDConnection* connection, char *command);
@findex spd_execute_command()

You can send an arbitrary SSIP command specified in the parameter @code{commnad}.

If the command is succesful, the function returns a 0. If there is no such
command or the command failed for some reason, it returns -1.

@code{connection} is the SPDConnection* connection created by spd_open().

@code{command} is a null terminated string containing a full SSIP command
without the terminating sequence @code{\r\n}.

For example:
@example
        spd_execute_command(fd, "SET SELF RATE 60");
        spd_execute_command(fd, "SOUND_ICON bell");
@end example 

It's not possible to use this function for composed commands like @code{SPEAK}
where you are receiving more than one reply. If this is your case, please
see `spd_send_data()'.
@end deffn

and, if specified, wait for the reply. The string can be an SSIP command, but
it can also be textual data or a command parameter.

If @code{wfr} (wait for reply) is set to SPD_WAIT_REPLY, you will receive the reply string
as the return value. If wfr is set to SPD_NO_REPLY, the return value is a NULL pointer.
In case wfr is set to SPD_WAIT_REPLY, you should always free the returned string.

@code{connection} is the SPDConnection* connection created by spd_open().

@code{message} is a null terminated string containing a full SSIP
string.  If this is a complete SSIP command, it must include the full
terminating sequence @code{\r\n}.

@code{wfr} is either SPD_WAIT_REPLY (integer value of 1) or SPD_NO_REPLY (0).
This specifies if you expect to get a reply on the send data according to SSIP.
For example if you are sending an ordinary text inside a @code{SPEAK} command,
you don't expect to get a reply. But you expect a reply after sending the final
sequence @code{\r\n.\r\n}.

For example (simplified by not checking and freeing the returned strings):
@example
        spd_send_data(conn, "SPEAK", SPD_WAIT_REPLY);
        spd_send_data(conn, "Hello world!\n", SPD_NO_REPLY);
        spd_send_data(conn, "How are you today?!", SPD_NO_REPLY);
        spd_send_data(conn, "\r\n.\r\n.", SPD_WAIT_REPLY);
@end example

@section Server Core

The main documentation for the server core is the code itself. This section
is only a general introduction intended to give you some basic information
and hints where to look for things. If you are going to make some modifications
in the server core, we will be happy if you get in touch with us on
@email{speechd@@freebsoft.org}.

The server core is composed of two main parts, each of them implemented
in a separate thread. The @emph{server part} handles the communication
with clients and, with the desired configuration options, stores the messages
in the priority queue. The @emph{speaking part} takes care about the
communication with the output modules, pulls messages out of the priority
queue in the right time and sends them to the appropriate synthesizer.

Synchronization between these two parts is done by thread mutexes.
Additionally, synchronization of the speaking part from both sides
(server part, output modules) is done via a SYSV/IPC semaphore.

@subheading Server part

After switching to the daemon mode (if required), it reads configuration
files and initializes the speaking part. Then it opens the socket
and waits for incomming data. This is implemented mainly in
@file{src/server/speechd.c} and @file{src/server/server.c}.

There are three types of events: new client connects to speechd,
old client disconnects or a client sends some data. In the third
case, this data is passed to the @code{parse()} function defined
in @file{src/server/parse.c}.

If the incomming data is a new message, it's stored in the
queues according to its priority. If it is some SSIP
commands, it's handled by the appropriate handles.
Handling of the @code{SET} family of commands can be found
in @file{src/server/set.c} and @code{HISTORY} commands are
processed in @file{src/server/history.c}.

All reply messages of SSIP are defined in @file{src/server/msg.h}.

@subheading Speaking part

This thread, the function @code{speak()} defined in
@file{src/server/speaking.c}, is created from the server part process
shortly after initialization. Then it enters an infinite loop and
waits on a SYSV/IPC semaphore until on of the following actions
happen:

@itemize
@item
The server adds a new message to the queue of messages waiting
to be said.
@item
The currently active output module signalizes that the message
that was being spoken is done.
@item
Pause or resume is requested.
@end itemize

After handling the rest of priority interaction (like actions
needed to repeat the last priority progress message) it decides
which action should be performed. Usually it's picking up
a message from the queue and sending it to the desired output
module (synthesizer), but sometimes it's handling the pause
or resume requests, and sometimes it's to do nothing.

As said before, this is the part of Speech Dispatcher that
talks to the output modules. It does so by using the output
interface defined in @file{src/server/output.c}.

@node Basic Structure, Communication Protocol for Output Modules, Output Modules, Output Modules
@subsection Basic Structure

Speech Dispatcher output modules are independent applications that,
using a simple common communication protocol, read commands from
standard input and then output replies on standard output,
communicating the requests to the particular software or hardware
synthesizer. Everything the output module writes on standard output
or reads from standard input should conform to the specifications
of the communication protocol. Additionally, standard error output
is used for logging of the modules.

Output modules binaries are usually located in
@file{bin/speechd-modules/} and are loaded automatically when Speech
Dispatcher starts, according to configuration.  Their standard
input/output/error output is redirected to a pipe to Speech Dispatcher
and this way both sides can communicate.

When the modules start, they are passed a name of a configuration file
that should be used for this particular output module. 

Each output module is started by Speech Dispatcher as:

@example
my_module "configfile"
@end example

where @code{configfile} is the full path to the desired configuration
file that the output module should parse.

@node Communication Protocol for Output Modules, How to Write New Output Module, Basic Structure, Output Modules
@subsection Communication Protocol for Output Modules

The protocol in which the output modules communicate on standard
input/output is based on @ref{Top,,SSIP,ssip, SSIP
Documentation}, although it is highly simplified and a little bit
modified for the different purpose here. Another difference
is that events notification is obligatory in modules communication,
while in SSIP, this is an optional feature. This is because Speech
Dispatcher has to know all the events happening in the output modules
for the purpose of synchronization of various messages.

Since it's very similar to SSIP, @ref{Top,,General Rules,ssip, SSIP
Documentation}, for a general description how the protocol looks
like. One of the exceptions is that since the output modules
communicate on standard input/output, we use only @code{LF} as the
line separator.

The return values are:
@itemize
@item 2xx         OK
@item 3xx         CLIENT ERROR or BAD SYNTAX or INVALID VALUE
@item 4xx         OUTPUT MODULE ERROR or INTERNAL ERROR

@item 700         EVENT INDEX MARK
@item 701         EVENT BEGIN
@item 702         EVENT END
@item 703         EVENT STOP
@item 704         EVENT PAUSE
@end itemize

@table @code
@item SPEAK
Start receiving a text message in the SSML format and synthesize it.
After sending a reply to the command, output module waits for the text
of the message.  The text can spread over any number of lines and is
finished by an end of line marker followed by the line containing the
single character @code{.} (dot).  Thus the complete character sequence
closing the input text is @code{LF . LF}.  If any line within the sent
text contains only a dot, an extra dot should be prepended before it.

During reception of the text message, output module doesn't send
response to the particular lines sent.  The response line is sent only
immediately after the @code{SPEAK} command and after receiving the
closing dot line. This doesn't provide any means of synchronization,
instead, event notification is used for this purpose.

There is no explicit upper limit on the size of the text.

If the @code{SPEAK} command is received while the output module
is already speaking, this is considered an error.

Example:
@example
SPEAK
202 OK SEND DATA
<speak>
Hello, GNU!
</speak>
.
200 OK SPEAKING
@end example

After receiving the full text (or the first part of it), the output
module is supposed to start synthesizing it and take care of
delivering it to an audio device. When (or just before it) the first
synthesized samples are delivered to the audio and start playing, the
output module must send the @code{BEGIN} event over the communication
socket to Speech Dispatcher, @xref{Events notification and index
marking}. After the audio stops playing, the event @code{STOP},
@code{PAUSE} or @code{END} must be delivered to Speech
Dispatcher. Additionally, if supported by the given synthesizer, the
output module can issue events associated to the included SSML index
marks when they are reached in the audio output.

@item CHAR
Synthesize a character. If the synthesizer supports a different behavior
for the event of ``character'', this should be used.

It works like the command @code{SPEAK} above, except that the argument
has to be exactly one line long. It contains the UTF-8 form of exactly
one character.

@item KEY
Synthesize a key name. If the synthesizer supports a different behavior
for the event of ``key name'', this should be used.

It works like the command @code{SPEAK} above, except that the argument
has to be exactly one line long. @xref{Top, ,SSIP KEY,ssip, SSIP
Documentation}, for the description of the allowed arguments.

@item SOUND_ICON
Produce a sound icon. According to the configuration of the particular
synthesizer, this can produce either a sound (e.g. .wav) or synthesize
some text.

It works like the command @code{SPEAK} above, except that the argument
has to be exactly one line long. It contains the symbolic name of the
icon that should be said. @xref{Top,,SSIP SOUND_ICON, ssip, SSIP
Documentation}, for more detailed description of the sound icons
mechanism.

@item STOP
Immediately stop speaking on the output device and cancel synthesizing
the current message so that the output module is prepared to receive a
new message. If there is currently no message being synthesized, it is
not considered an error to call @code{STOP} anyway.

This command is asynchronous. The output module is not supposed to
send any reply (not even error reply).

It should return immediately, although stopping the synthesizer may
require a little bit more time. The module must issue one of the events
@code{STOPPED} or @code{END} when the module is finally
stopped. @code{END} is issued when the playing stopped by itself
before the module could terminate it or if the architecture of the
output module doesn't allow it to decide, otherwise @code{STOPPED}
should be used.

@example
STOP
@end example

@item PAUSE
Stop speaking the current message at a place where we can exactly
determine the position (preferably after a __spd_ index mark).  This
doesn't have to be immediately and can be delayed even for a few
seconds. (Knowing the position exactly is important so that we can
later continue the message without gaps or overlapping.) It doesn't do
anything else (like storing the message etc.).

This command is asynchronous. The output module is not supposed to
send any reply (not even error reply).

For example:
@example
PAUSE
@end example

@item SET
Set one or several speech parameters for the future messages.

Each of the parameters is written on a single line in the form
@example
name=value
@end example
where @code{value} can be either a number or a string, depending on
the name of the parameter.

The @code{SET} environment is terminated by a dot on a single line.
Thus the complete character sequence closing the input text is
@code{LF . LF}

During reception of the settings, output module doesn't send any
response to the particular lines sent.  The response line is sent only
immediately after the @code{SET} command and after receiving the
closing dot line.

The available parameters that accept numerical values are @code{rate},
@code{pitch}.

The available parameters that accept string values are
@code{punctuation_mode}, @code{spelling_mode}, @code{cap_let_recogn},
@code{voice}. @code{language}.  The arguments are the same as for the
corresponding SSIP commands, except that they are written with small
letters. @xref{Top,,Parameter Setting Commands,ssip, SSIP
Documentation}.  The conversion between these string values and the
corresponding C enum variables can be easily done using
@file{intl/fdsetconv.c}.

Not all of these parameters must be set and the value of the string
arguments can also be @code{NULL}. If some of the parameters aren't
set, the output module should use it's default.

It's not necessary to set these parameters on the synthesizer right
away, instead, it can be postponed until some message to say arrives.

Here is an example:
@example
SET
203 OK RECEIVING SETTINGS
rate=20
pitch=-10
punctuation_mode=all
spelling_mode=on
punctuation_some=NULL
.
203 OK SETTINGS RECEIVED
@end example

@item QUIT
Terminates the output module. It should send the response, deallocate
all the resources, close all descriptors, terminate all child
processes etc. Then the output module should exit itself.

@example
QUIT
210 OK QUIT
@end example
@end table

@subsubsection Events notification and index marking
@anchor{Events notification and index marking}

Each output module must take care of sending asynchronous
notifications whenever the synthesizer (or the module) starts or stops
to output audio on the speakers. Additionally, whenever possible, the
output module should report back to Speech Dispatcher index marks
found in the incomming SSML text whenever they are reached while
speaking. See SSML specifications for more details about the
@code{mark} element

Event and index mark notifications are reported by simply writing them
to the standard output. An event notification must never get in between
of synchronous commands (those which require a reply) and their reply.


@table @code

@item BEGIN

This event must be issued whenever the module starts to speak the
given message. If this is not possible, it can issue it when it
starts to synthesize the message or when it receives the message.

It is prepended by the code @code{701} and takes the form

@example
701 BEGIN
@end example

@item END

This event must be issued whenever the module terminates speaking the
given message because it reached its end. If this is not possible, it
can issue this event when it is ready to receive a new message after
speaking the previous message.

Ech @code{END} must allways be preceeded (possibly not directly) by a
@code{BEGIN}.

It is prepended by the code @code{702} and takes the form

@example
702 END
@end example

@item STOP

This event should be issued whenever the module terminates speaking
the given message without reaching its end (as a consequence of
receiving the STOP command or because of some error) not because of
a @code{PAUSE} command. When the synthesizer in use doesn't allow
the module to decide, the event @code{END} can be used instead.

Ech @code{STOP} must allways be preceeded (possibly not directly) by a
@code{BEGIN}.

It is prepended by the code @code{703} and takes the form

@example
703 STOP
@end example

@item PAUSE

This event should be issued whenever the module terminates speaking
the given message without reaching its end because of receiving the
@code{PAUSE} command.

Ech @code{PAUSE} must allways be preceeded (possibly not directly) by a
@code{BEGIN}.

It is prepended by the code @code{704} and takes the form

@example
704 PAUSE
@end example

@item INDEX MARK

This event should be issued by the output module (if supported)
whenever an index mark (SSML tag @code{<mark/>}) is passed in speaking the incomming message.
It is preceeded by the code @code{700} and takes the form

@example
700-name
700 INDEX MARK
@end example

where @code{name} is the value of the SSML attribute @code{name} in
the tag @code{<mark/>}.

@end table

@node How to Write New Output Module, The Skeleton of an Output Module, Communication Protocol for Output Modules, Output Modules
@subsection How to Write New Output Module

If you want to write your own output module, there are basically two
ways how to do it. Either you can program it all itself, which is fine
as long as you stick to the definition of an output module and it's
communication protocol, or you can use our @file{module_*.c} tools.
If you use these tools, you will only have to write the core functions
like module_speak() and module_stop etc. and you will not have to
worry about the communication protocol and other formal things that
are common for all modules. Here is how you can do it using the
provided tools.

We will recommend here a basic structure of the code for an output
module you should follow, although it's perfectly ok to establish your
own if you have reasons to do so, if all the necessary functions and
data are defined somewhere in the file. For this purpose, we will use
examples from the output module for Flite (Festival Lite), so it's
recommended to keep looking at @code{flite.c} for reference.

A few rules you should respect:
@itemize
@item
The @file{module_*.c} files should be included at the specified place and
in the specified order, because they include directly some pieces of the
code and wouldn't work on other places.
@item
If one or more new threads are used in the output module, they must block all signals.
@item
On module_close(), all lateral threads and processes should be terminated,
all memmory freed. Don't suppose module_close() is allways called before exit()
and the sources will be freed automatically.
@item
We will be happy if all the copyrights are assigned to Brailcom, o.p.s.
in order for us to be in a better legal position against possible intruders.
@end itemize

@node The Skeleton of an Output Module, Output Module Functions, How to Write New Output Module, Output Modules
@subsection The Skeleton of an Output Module 

Each output module should include @file{intl/fdset.h} where the
SPDMsgSettings structure is defined to be able to handle the different
speech synthesis settings.

@example
#include "fdset.h"
@end example

Additionally, it's also reccomended to include @file{module_utils.c}
which provides many tools to help writing output modules and make the
code simpler. If your plugin needs the audio tools also (if you take
care of the output to the soundcard instead of the synthesizer),
you have to also include @file{module_utils_audio.c}

@example
#include "module_utils.c"
#include "module_utils_audio.c"
@end example

The definition of macros @code{MODULE_NAME} and @code{MODULE_VERSION}
should follow:

@example
#define MODULE_NAME     "flite"
#define MODULE_VERSION  "0.1"
@end example

If you want to use the @code{DBG(message)} macro from @file{module_utils.c}
to print out debugging messages, you should insert these two lines. (Please
don't use printf for debugging, this doesn't work with multiple processes!)
(You will later have to actually start debugging in @code{module_init()})

@example
DECLARE_DEBUG();
@end example

You don't have to define the prototypes of the core functions
like module_speak() and module_stop(), these all already
defined in @file{module_utils.c}

Optionally, if your output module requires some special configuration,
apart from defining voices and configuring debugging (they are handled
differently, see bellow), you can declare the requested option
here. It will expand into a dotconf callback and declaration of the
variable.

(You will later have to actually register these options for
Speech Dispatcher in @code{module_load()})

There are currently 4 types of possible configuration options:

@itemize
@item @code{MOD_OPTION_1_INT(name);   /* Set up `int name' */}
@item @code{MOD_OPTION_1_STR(name);   /* Set up `char* name' */}
@item @code{MOD_OPTION_2(name);       /* Set up `char *name[2]' */}
@item @code{MOD_OPTION_@{2,3@}_HT(name);  /* Set up a hash table */}
@end itemize

@xref{Output Modules Configuration}.

For example Flite uses 2 options:
@example
MOD_OPTION_1_INT(FliteMaxChunkLength);
MOD_OPTION_1_STR(FliteDelimiters);
@end example

Every output module is being started in 2 phases: @emph{loading} and
@emph{initialization}.

The goal of loading is to initialize empty structures for storing
settings and declare the DotConf callbacks for parsing configuration
files. In the later phase, initialization, all the configuration has
been read yet and the output module can accomplish the rest (check if
the synthesizer works, set up threads etc.).

You should start by the definition of @code{module_load()}. 

@example
int
module_load(void)
@{
@end example

Then you should initialize the settings tables. These are defined in
@file{module_utils.c} and will be used to store the settings received
by the @code{SET} command.
@example
    INIT_SETTINGS_TABLES();
@end example 

Also, define the configuration callbacks for debugging if you use
the @code{DBG()} macro.

@example
    REGISTER_DEBUG();
@end example

Now you can finally register the options for the configuration file
parsing. Just use these macros:
@itemize
        @item MOD_OPTION_1_INT_REG(name, default);  /* for integer parameters */
        @item MOD_OPTION_1_STR_REG(name, default);  /* for string parameters */
        @item MOD_OPTION_MORE_REG(name);   /* for an array of strings */
        @item MOD_OPTION_HT_REG(name);     /* for hash tables */
@end itemize

Again, an example from Flite:
@example
    MOD_OPTION_1_INT_REG(FliteMaxChunkLength, 300);
    MOD_OPTION_1_STR_REG(FliteDelimiters, ".");
@end example

If you want to enable the mechanism for setting
voices through AddVoice, use this function (for
an example see @code{generic.c}):

Example from Festival:
@example
    module_register_settings_voices();
@end example

@xref{Output Modules Configuration}.

If everything went correctly, the function should return 0, otherwise -1.

@example
    return 0;
@}
@end example

The second phase of starting an output module is handled by:

@example
int
module_init(void)
@{
@end example

If you use the DBG() macro, you should init debugging on the start
of this function. From that moment, you can use DBG(). Apart from that,
the body of this function is entirely up to you. You should do all the
necessary initialization of the particular synthesizer.  All declared
configuration variables and configuration hash tables, together with
the definition of voices, are filled with their values (either default
or read from configuration), so you can use them already.

@example
   INIT_DEBUG();
   DBG("FliteMaxChunkLength = %d\n", FliteMaxChunkLength);
   DBG("FliteDelimiters = %s\n", FliteDelimiters);
@end example

This function should return 0 if the module was initialized
successfully, or -1 if some failure was encountered. In this case, you
should clean up everything, cancel threads, deallocate memory etc.; no
more functions of this output module will be touched (except for other
tries to load and initialize the module).

Example from Flite:

@example
    /* Init flite and register a new voice */
    flite_init();
    flite_voice = register_cmu_us_kal();

    if (flite_voice == NULL)@{
        DBG("Couldn't register the basic kal voice.\n");
        return -1;
    @}
    [...]
@end example

Now you have to define all the synthesis control functions
@code{module_speak}, @code{module_stop} etc.  See @ref{Output Module
Functions}. 

At the end, this simple include provides the main() function and all
the functionality related to being an output module of Speech
Dispatcher (parsing argv[] parameters, communicating on stdin/stdout,
...). It's recommended to study this file carefully and try to
understand what exactly it does, as it will be part of the source code
of your output module.

@example
#include "module_main.c"
@end example

If it doesn't work, it's most likely not your fault, complain!  This
manual is not complete and the instructions in this sections aren't
either. Get in touch with us and together we can figure out what's
wrong, fix it and then warn others in this manual.

@node Output Module Functions, Module Utils Functions and Macros, The Skeleton of an Output Module, Output Modules
@subsection Output Module Functions

@deffn {Output Module Functions} int module_write (char *data, size_t bytes, EMessageType msgtype)
@findex module_speak()

This is the function where the actual speech output is produced. It is
called every time Speech Dispatcher decides to send a message to
synthesis. The data of length @var{bytes} are passed in
a NULL terminated string @var{data}.  The argument @var{msgtype}
defines what type of message it is (different types should be handled
differently, if the synthesizer supports it).

Each output module should take care of setting the output device to
the parameters from msg_settings (defined in module_utils.c) (See
SPDMsgSettings in @file{intl/fdset.h}). However, it is not an error if
some of these values are ignored. At least rate, pitch and language
should be set correctly.

Speed and pitch are values between -100 and 100 included. 0 is the default
value that represents normal speech flow. So -100 is the slowest (or lowest)
and +100 is the fastest (or highest) speech.

The language parameter is given as a null-terminated string containing 
the name of the language according to RFC 1776 (en, cs, fr, ...). If the
requested language is not supported by this synthesizer, it's ok to abort
and return 0, because that's an error in user settings.

Other parameters are defined in @code{SPDMsgSettings} in @file{intl/fdset.h}.

An easy way to set the parameters is using the UPDATE_PARAMETER() and
UPDATE_STRING_PARAMETER() macros. @xref{Module Utils Functions and
Macros}.

Example from festival:
@example
    UPDATE_STRING_PARAMETER(language, festival_set_language);
    UPDATE_PARAMETER(voice, festival_set_voice);
    UPDATE_PARAMETER(rate, festival_set_rate);
    UPDATE_PARAMETER(pitch, festival_set_pitch);
    UPDATE_PARAMETER(punctuation_mode, festival_set_punctuation_mode);
    UPDATE_PARAMETER(cap_let_recogn, festival_set_cap_let_recogn);
@end example

This function should return 0 if it fails and 1 if the delivery
to the synthesis is successful. It should return immediately,
because otherwise, it would block stopping, priority handling
and other important things in Speech Dispatcher.

If there is a need to stay longer, you should create a separate thread
or process. This is for example the case of some software synthesizers
which use a blocking function (eg. spd_audio_play) or hardware devices
that have to send data to output modules at some particular
speed. Note that if you use threads for that purpose, you have to set
them to ignore all signals. See @code{flite.c} for reference.
@end deffn

@deffn {Output module function}  {int module_stop} (void)
@findex module_stop()

This function should stop the synthesis of the currently spoken message
immediately and throw away the rest of the message.

It should return 0 on success, -1 otherwise.
@end deffn

@deffn {Output module function}  {size_t module_pause} (void)
@findex module_pause()

This function should stop speaking on the synthesizer (or sending
data to soundcard) and return the identification number of the
last index mark or the index mark where the text was paused.

This may be a different approach of what you would
expect on the first sight, but it's important to understand that
simply sending some @@pause to the output device won't work.
In Speech Dispatcher, these requests for pause are handled on a
client-per-client basis, so the output device can't be blocked
for other clients. For example, a user can pause the text in
Emacs buffer in order to, say, check new mail. If the output
device would be blocked by the Emacs pause, he couldn't check
his email, because there would be no output.

This function can be blocking for a short time, so you can wait till
an index mark is reached.

For some software synthesizer the desired effect can be archieved in this way:
When @code{module_write()} is called, you execute a separate
process and pass it the requested message. This process
cuts the message into sentences and then runs in a loop
and sends these pieces to synthesis. If a signal arrives
from @code{module_pause()}, you set a flag and stop that loop
at the point where next piece of text would be synthesized.
Instead, you return the rest of the unprocessed text to
@code{module_pause()}.

It's generally better if the ``returned text'' overlays
a little bit with what was actually said than if there is
a gap.

If the given output device doesn't support synchronization
(@pxref{module_is_speaking}), it should execute STOP on the output
device and return 0.

It's not an error if this function is called when the device
is not speaking. In this case, it should return 0.
@end deffn

@deffn {Output module function}  {static gint module_is_speaking} (void)
@findex module_is_speaking()
@anchor{module_is_speaking}

This function is very important to let Speech Dispatcher know how to
regulate the speech flow between different queues, programs and even
other synthesizers. On calling it, the output module must decide
whether there is currently any output being produced in the speakers.

It should return 0 if the synthesis is silent, 1 if it is speaking.

This can be a very hard problem and it's not clear how to do it
with different synthesizers that don't support backward communication.
Sometimes maybe there is a possibility to calculate a good estimate
(one second or so), but if there is really no way how to tell,
it can also return 2 for ``don't know''. The usefulness of such
output module would be highly reduced: there will be problems in
cooperating with other output devices, no real possibility to
use sound-mapped sound icons, priorities wouldn't sometimes work,
it will sometimes cut-off text etc.

You should do your best to get it working (sometimes there are
not-obvious ways around), but if this effort fails, it's better
to return 2 than a bad estimate (which can cause yet a greater damage).
Not that such a module is still useful, because the user can map all
his sound-icons to text, use only this output device etc.

This function should return very fast, because Speech Dispatcher calls
it very often for different purposes.

@end deffn

@deffn {Output module function}  {int module_close(int status)} (void)
@findex module_close()

This function is called when Speech Dispatcher terminates.  The output
module should terminate all threads and processes, free all resources,
close all sockets etc.  Never assume this function is called only when
Speech Dispatcher terminates and exit(0) will do the work for you.  It's
perfectly ok for Speech Dispatcher to load, unload or reload output modules
in the middle of it's run.

If the parameter @code{status} is non-zero, the process should
terminate with this error value.

This function never returns, instead, it should call exit() to terminate
the whole process.

@subsection Module Utils Functions and Macros

This section describes the various variables, functions and macros
that are available in the @file{module_utils.c} file. They are
intended to make writing new output modules easier and allow the
programmer to reuse existing pieces of code instead of writing
everything from scratch.

@end menu

@node Initialization Macros and Functions, Generic Macros and Functions, Module Utils Functions and Macros, Module Utils Functions and Macros
@subsubsection Initialization Macros and Functions

@deffn {Module Utils macro} INIT_SETTINGS_TABLES ()
@findex INIT_SETTINGS_TABLES
This macro initializes the settings tables where the parameters
received with the @code{SET} command are stored. You must call
this macro if you want to use the @code{UPDATE_PARAMETER()}
and @code{UPDATE_STRING_PARAMETER()} macros.

It is intended to be called from inside a function just
after the output module starts.
@end deffn

@subsubsection Debugging Macros
@deffn {Module Utils macro} DBG (format, ...)
@findex DBG
DBG() outputs a debugging message, if the @code{Debug} option in module's
configuration is set, to the file specified in configuration ad
@code{DebugFile}. The parameter syntax is the same as for the printf()
function. In fact, it calls printf() internally.
@end deffn

@deffn {Module Utils macro} FATAL (text)
@findex FATAL
Outputs a message specified as @code{text} and calls exit() with
the value EXIT_FAILURE. This terminates the whole output module
without trying to kill the children processes or freeing other
resources other than those that will be freed by the system.

It is intended to be used after some severe error has happened.
@end deffn

@node Generic Macros and Functions, Functions used by module_main.c, Initialization Macros and Functions, Module Utils Functions and Macros
@subsubsection Generic Macros and Functions

@deffn {Module Utils macro} UPDATE_PARAMETER (param, setter)
@findex UPDATE_PARAMETER
Looks if the integer or enum parameter specified in @code{param}
(e.g. rate, pitch, cap_let_recogn, ...) changed since the
last time when the @code{setter} function was called.

If it changed, it calls the function @code{setter} with the
new value. (The new value is stored in the msg_settings
structure that is created by module_utils.c and that
you normally don't have to care about.)

The function @code{setter} should be defined as:
@example
void setter_name(type value);
@end example

Please look at the @code{SET} command in the communication protocol
for the list of all available parameters. 
@pxref{Communication Protocol for Output Modules}.

An example from Festival output module:
@verbatim
static void
festival_set_rate(signed int rate)
{
    assert(rate >= -100 && rate <= +100);
    festivalSetRate(festival_info, rate);
}
[...]
int
module_write(char *data, size_t bytes)
{
    [...]
    UPDATE_PARAMETER(rate, festival_set_rate);
    UPDATE_PARAMETER(pitch, festival_set_pitch);
    [...]
}
@end verbatim
@end deffn

@deffn {Module Utils macro} UPDATE_STRING_PARAMETER (param, setter)
@findex  UPDATE_STRING_PARAMETER
The same as @code{UPDATE_PARAMETER} except that it works for the
parameters with a string value.
@end deffn

@node Functions used by module_main.c, Functions for use when talking to synthesizer, Generic Macros and Functions, Module Utils Functions and Macros
@subsubsection Functions used by @file{module_main.c}

@deffn {Module Utils function} char* do_speak(void)
@findex do_speak
Takes care about the communication after the @code{SPEAK} command was
received. Calls @code{module_write()} when the full text is received.

It returns a response according to the communication protocol.
@end deffn

@deffn {Module Utils function} char* do_stop(void)
@findex do_stop
Calls the @code{module_stop()} function of the particular
output module.

It returns a response according to the communication protocol.
@end deffn

@deffn {Module Utils function} char* do_pause(void)
@findex do_pause
Calls the @code{module_pause()} function of the particular
output module.

It returns a response according to the communication protocol
and the value returned by @code{module_pause()}.
@end deffn

@deffn {Module Utils function} char* do_set()
@findex do_set
Takes care about the communication after the @code{SET} command was
received. Doesn't call any particular function of the output module,
only sets the values in the settings tables. (You should then call the
@code{UPDATE_PARAMETER()} macro in module_write() to actually set the
synthesizer to these values.)

It returns a response according to the communication protocol.
@end deffn

@deffn {Module Utils function} char* do_speaking()
@findex do_speaking
Calls the @code{module_speaking()} function.

It returns a response according to the communication protocol
and the value returned by @code{module_speaking()}.
@end deffn

@deffn {Module Utils function} void do_quit()
@findex do_quit
Prints the farewell message to the standard output, according
to the protocol. Then it calls @code{module_close(0)}.
@end deffn

@node Functions for use when talking to synthesizer, Multi-process output modules, Functions used by module_main.c, Module Utils Functions and Macros
@subsubsection Functions for use when talking to synthesizer

@deffn {Module Utils function} static int module_get_message_part (
const char* message, char* part, unsigned int *pos, size_t maxlen, const char* dividers)
@findex  module_get_message_part

Gets a part of the @code{message} according to the specified @code{dividers}
and encountered index marks, @xref{Index Marks in Output Modules}.

It scans the text in @code{message} from the byte specified by
@code{*pos} and looks for one of the characters specified in
@code{dividers} followed by a whitespace character, index marks or the
terminating NULL byte. If one of them is encountered, the read text is
stored in @code{part} and the number of bytes read is
returned. However, if the current position @code{message[*pos]} when
calling this function is on the beginning of an index mark, nothing is
stored in @code{part}, 0 is returned and the global variable
@code{current_index_mark} is set to the number of the encountered
index mark. If end of @code{message} is reached, the return value is
-1.

@code{message} is the text to process. It must be a NULL-terminated
uni-byte string.

@code{part} is a pointer to the place where the output text should
be stored. It must contain at least @code{maxlen} bytes of space.

@code{maxlen} is the maximum number of bytes that should be written
to @code{part}.

@code{dividers} is a NULL-terminated uni-byte string containing
the punctuation characters where the message should be divided
in smaller parts (if they are followed by a whitespace).

After returning, @code{current_index_mark} is either -1 or the number
of the encountered index mark and in @code{pos} is stored the position
where the function terminated in processing @code{message}.
@end deffn

@node Multi-process output modules, Memory Handling Functions, Functions for use when talking to synthesizer, Module Utils Functions and Macros
@subsubsection Multi-process output modules

@deffn {Module Utils function} void module_speak_thread_wfork (sem_t *semaphore,
pid_t *process_pid, TChildFunction child_function, TParentFunction parent_function,
int *speaking_flag, char **message, const size_t maxlen, const char *dividers,
size_t *module_position, int *pause_requested)
@findex module_speak_thread_wfork

This function waits on the specified @code{semaphore} for activity.
When the semaphore is on, it forks and creates pipes between the two
processes in both directions.

In the child, it starts the @code{child_function}. This function
is supposed to never return. If it returns, exit(0) is called
immediatelly.

In the parent, it starts the @code{parent_function} and passes the
parameters. It waits until the function returns and writes it's return
value to the @code{*module_position}. It then cleans the process, logs
the return values of @code{waitpid()} using DBG, sets *speaking_flag
to 0 and calls module_signal_end().

It is intended to be run from a separate thread, because it doesn't
return and it would block the communication on stdin/stdout.

@code{semaphore} is the pthread-type semaphore on which requests
for @code{child_function()} to run will be posted.

@code{process_pid} is a pointer to an integer where the pid of the
newly started child process should be stored.

@code{child_function} is the function that should be called in the child.

@code{parent_function} is the function that should be called in the parent.

@code{speaking_flag} is a pointer to an integer where this function
will write a 0 after the parent function terminates. This should mean
that the synthesizer stopped speaking.

@code{message} is a pointer to a NULL-terminated string containing the message
that should be passed to the parent function for synthesis.

@code{maxlen} is the maximum number of bytes that should be transfered from
parent to child over the pipe.

@code{dividers} is a NULL-terminated string containing the punctuation characters
at which the parent function should divide the message in smaller pieces.

@code{module_position} is a pointer to an integer where the actual position
(according to index marks) where the speaking terminated, as returned by
the parent function, will be stored.

@code{pause_requested} is a pointer to an integer flag, which is either 0 if
no pause request is pending, or 1 if the parent function should terminate
at a convenient place at the message because a pause is requested.

The two types of functions @code{child_function} and @code{parent_function}
are:

@example
typedef void (*TChildFunction)(TModuleDoublePipe dpipe, const size_t maxlen);
typedef size_t (*TParentFunction)(TModuleDoublePipe dpipe, const char* message,
                             const size_t maxlen, const char* dividers,
                             int *pause_requested);
@end example

The parameters have the same meaning as stated above. Additionally
there is the @code{dpipe} parameter which contains the information
necessary for communicating through pipes between the parent and the
child and vice-versa. Each of these functions should initialize
the pipes at the beginning and then communicate through them. The
prefered functions to do that are listed bellow.

@example
typedef struct@{
    int pc[2];            /* Parent to child pipe */
    int cp[2];            /* Child to parent pipe */
@}TModuleDoublePipe;
@end example
@end deffn

@deffn {Module Utils function} size_t module_parent_wfork (
TModuleDoublePipe dpipe, const char* message, const size_t maxlen,
const char* dividers, int *pause_requested)
@findex module_parent_wfork

This is a generic function that can be used as the @code{parent_function()}
for @code{module_speak_thread_wfork}. It simply sends the data to the
child in smaller pieces and waits for confirmation with a single
@code{C} character on the pipe from child to parent.

In the beginning, it initializes the pipes and then it enters a simple cycle:
@enumerate
@item
Reads a part of the message or an index mark using
@code{module_get_message_part()}.
@item
Looks if there isn't a pending request for pause and handles
it.
@item
Sends the current part of the message to the child
using @code{module_parent_dp_write()}.
@item
Waits until a single character @code{C} comes from the other pipe
using @code{module_parent_dp_read()}.
@item
Repeats the cycle or terminates, if there is no more data.
@end enumerate
@end deffn

@deffn {Module Utils function} int module_parent_wait_continue(TModuleDoublePipe dpipe)
@findex module_parent_wait_continue
Waits until the character @code{C} (continue) is read from the pipe from child.
This function is intended to be run from the parent.

@code{dpipe} is the double pipe used for communication between the child and parent.

Returns 0 if the character was read or 1 if the pipe was broken before the
character could have been read.
@end deffn

@deffn {Module Utils function} void module_parent_dp_init (TModuleDoublePipe dpipe)
@findex module_parent_dp_init

@node Index Marks in Output Modules,  , Module Utils Functions and Macros, Output Modules
@subsection Index Marks in Output Modules

Output modules need to provide some kind of synchronization and they have to
give Speech Dispatcher back some information about what part of the message
is currently being said. On the other side, output modules are not able to tell
the exact position in the text as the number of bytes from the beginning of
the message because various conversions and message processing take place
(sometimes punctuation and spelling substitution, the message needs to be
recoded from multibyte to unibyte coding etc.) before the text reaches
the synthesizer.

For this reason, Speech Dispatcher places so-called index marks in
the text it sends to it's output modules. They have the form:

@example
@@id_number@@
@end example

@code{id_number} is the identification number associated to each index
mark. It's unique with respect to each message.

When an index mark is reached, it's identification number should be stored
so that the output module is able to tell Speech Dispatcher the number
of the last index mark. Also, index marks are the best place to stop
when the module is requested to pause (although it's ok to stop at
some nearer place and report the last index mark).

Because index mark use the @code{@@} character, all the regular
@code{@@} characters are replaced by an escape sequence @code{@@@@}
and should be converted back before sending the text to a text-to-speech
system. In a similar way, the index marks should be stripped after their
information is stored.

how to set up anonymous access to our CVS.

However, you may prefer to download Speech Dispatcher in a binary
package for your system. We don't distribute such packages ourselves.
If you run Debian GNU/Linux, it should be in the central repository
under the name @code{speechd}. If you run an rpm-based distribution

@node Reporting Bugs, How You Can Help, Download and Contact, Top
@chapter Reporting Bugs

If you believe you found a bug in Speech Dispatcher, we will be very
grateful if you let us know about it. Please do it by email on the
address @email{speechd@@bugs.freebsoft.org}, but please don't send us
messages larger than half a megabyte unless we ask you.

To report a bug in a way that is useful for the developers is not
as easy as it may seem. Here are some hints that you should follow in
order to give us the best information and so that we can find and fix
the bug easily.

First of all, please try to describe the problem as exactly as you
can. We prefer raw data over speculations about where the problem may
lie. Please try to explain in what situation does the bug happen. Even
if it's a general bug that happens in many situations, please try to
describe at least one case in as many details, as possible.

Also, please specify the versions of programs that you use when
the bug happens. This is not only Speech Dispatcher, but also
the client application you use (speechd-el, say, etc.) and
the synthesizer name and version.

If you can reproduce the bug, please send us the log file also.  This
is very useful, because otherwise, we may not be able to reproduce the
bug with our configuration and program versions that differ from
yours. Configuration must be set to logging priority at least 4, but
best 5, so that it's useful for debugging purposes. You can do so in
@file{etc/speech-dispatcher/speechd.conf} by modifying the variable
@code{LogLevel}. Also, you may want to modify the log destination with
variable @code{LogFile}. After modifying these options, please restart
Speech Dispatcher and repeat the situation in which the bug
happens. After it happened, please take the log and attach it to the
bug report, preferably compressed using @code{gzip}. But note, that
when logging with level 5, all the data that come to Speech Dispatcher
are also recorded, so make sure there are no sensitive information
when you are reproducing the bug. Please make sure you switch back
to priority 3 or lower logging, because priority 4 or 5 produces
really huge logs.

If you are a programmer and you find a bug, that is reproducible in
SSIP, you can send us the sequence of SSIP commands, that leads to the
bug (preferably from starting the connection). You can also try to
reproduce the bug in a simple test-script under
@file{speech-dispatcher/src/tests} in the source tree. Please check
@file{speech-dispatcher/src/tests/README} and see the other tests scripts here
for an example.

When the bug is a SEGMENTATION FAULT, a backtrace from gdb is also
valuable, but if you are not familiar with gdb, don't bother with
that, we may ask you to do it later.

On the last place, you may also send us a guess of what do you think
that happens in Speech Dispatcher that causes the bug, but this is
usually not very helpful. If you are able to provide additional technical
information instead, please do so.

@node How You Can Help, Appendices, Reporting Bugs, Top
@chapter How You Can Help

If you want to contribute to the development of Speech Dispatcher,
we will be very happy if you do so. Please contact us on 
@email{manage@@freebsoft.org}.

There is a short, definitively not exhaustive, list of how you can
help us and other users.

@itemize
@item
@emph{Donate money:} We are a non-profit organization and we can't work without
funding. Brailcom, o.p.s. created Speech Dispatcher, speechd-el and also works
on other projects to help blind and visually impaired users of computers. We build
on Free Software and GNU/Linux, because we believe this is the right way. But it
won't be possible when we have no money. @uref{http://www.freebsoft.org/}

@item
@emph{Report bugs:} Every user, even if he can't give us money and he is not
a programmer, can help us very much by just using our software and telling
us about the bugs and inconveniences he encounters. A good user community that
reports bugs is a crucial part of development of a good Free Software package.
We can't test our software under all circumstances and on all platforms, so each
constructive bug report is highly appreciated. You can report bugs in Speech
Dispatcher on @email{speechd@@bugs.freebsoft.org}.

@item
@emph{Write or modify an application to support synthesis:} With
Speech Dispatcher, we have provided an interface that allows
applications easy access to speech synthesis. However powerful, it's
no more than an interface, and it's useless on it's own. Now it's time
to write the particular client applications, or modify existing
applications so that they can support speech synthesis.  It is useful
if the application needs a specific interface for blind people or if
it wants to use speech synthesis for educational or other purposes.

@item
@emph{Develop new voices and language definitions for Festival:} In
the world of Free Software, currently Festival is the most promising
interface for Text-to-Speech processing and speech synthesis. It's
extensible and highly configurable platform for developing synthetic
voices. If there is a lack of synthetic voices or no voices at all for
some language, we believe the wisest solution is to try to develop
a voice in Festival. It's certainly not advisable to develop your
own synthesizer, if the goal is producing a quality voice system
in reasonable time. Festival developers provide a nice documentation
about how to develop a voice and a lot of tools that help doing
this. We found that some language definitions can be constructed
by canibalizing the already existing definitions and can be tuned
later. As for the voice samples, one can temporarily use the
MBROLA project voices. But please note that, although they are
downloadable for free (as price), they are not Free Software
and it would be wonderful if we could replace them by Free Software
alternatives as soon as possible.
See @uref{http://www.cstr.ed.ac.uk/projects/festival/}.

@item
@emph{Help us with this or other Free-b-Soft projects:} Please look at
@uref{http://www.freebsoft.org} to find information about our
projects. There is a plenty of work to be done for the blind and
visually impaired people to make their work with computers easier.

@item
@emph{Spread a word about Speech Dispatcher and Free Software:} You can
help us, and the whole community around Free Software, just by telling
your friends about the amazing world of Free Software. It doesn't
have to be just about Speech Dispatcher, you can tell them about
other project or about Free Software in general. Remember that
Speech Dispatcher could only arise out of understanding of some people
of the principles and ideas behind Free Software. And this is mostly
the same for the rest of the Free Software world.

TODO: This needs to be rewritten  

Speech Dispatcher project comes to provide a device independent layer for
speech synthesis. It should provide a simple interface for client
applications (applications, that want to speak) as well as for device
driver modules (for particular speech synthesis).

High quality speech synthesis has been available for a long time and now
it's usable even by ordinary users on their home PC's. It comes sometimes
as a necessity, sometimes as a good feature for programs to provide speech
output.  There is a wide field of possible uses from educational software,
through specialized systems (hospitals, laboratories, telephony servers).
For visually impaired users it is one of the two essential ways of getting
the output from computer (the second one is Braille display). That's also
where Speech Dispatcher comes from.

There are different speech synthesizers with different capabilities.  Some
of them are hardware, some of them are software.  Some of them are Free
Software and are are available on the Internet.  However, none of them is
pre-installed in one of the widely used GNU/Linux distributions.
Programmers have really hard times when they want to make their program
speak because they need to find some suitable synthesizer (long hours of
experiments and so on...) and then make it work with their program.  They
often need to write output device drivers for these programs or hardware
devices and are doing it again and again.  You can imagine it all fails
when an innocent user executes two programs with speech output at once ---
if they even start both (what I doubt), they will be shouting one over the
other.  This makes it very hard for programmers to implement speech support
to their programs (for blind users or simply to make a better user
interface) and it's one of the reasons we still don't fully exploit what
speech synthesis technology offers.

In an ideal world, programmers could use similar commands for speech
synthesis as they do for normal text output (printf, puts, ...).  In an
ideal world, there would be some speech_printf() that would take care of
saying your message in the right time without interrupting others, without
you being obligated to take care of how exactly the communication with
speech synthesizer is implemented and without you having to worry about
what synthesizer to use and if it's available.  In an ideal world, there
would be some speech synthesizer in each GNU/Linux distribution and some
speech dispatcher taking care of all applications that want to speak,
allowing user to configure speech parameters and providing simple interface
(as speech_printf()) through some shared library for programmers.  It will
be a long way until we achieve this state of things, but with Speech
Dispatcher, we are taking the first steps...

@node Basic Design, Features Overview, Motivation, Introduction
@section Design
@cindex Design
        
The communication between all
these applications and synthesizers is a great mess. For this purpose,
we wanted Speech Dispatcher to be a layer separating applications and
synthesizers so that applications wouldn't have to care about synthesizers
and synthesizers wouldn't have to care about interaction with applications.

We decided we would implement Speech Dispatcher as a server receiving
commands from applications over a protocol called @code{SSIP},
parsing them and if it's necessary and calling appropriate functions
of output modules communicating with the different synthesizers.
These output modules are implemented as plug-ins, so that the user
can just load a new module if he wants to use new synthesizer.

Each client (application that wants to speaks) opens a socket
connection to Speech Dispatcher and calls functions like spd_say(),
spd_stop(), spd_pause() provided by the shared library. This
shared library is still on the client side and sends Speech
Dispatcher SSIP commands over the socket. When these arrive
at Speech Dispatcher, it parses them, reads the text that should
be said and put it in a queues according to the priority
of this message and other criteria. It then decides when,
with which parameters (set up by the client and the user)
and on which synthesizer it will say the message. These requests
are handled by the output plug-ins (output modules) for different
hardware and software synthesizers and then said aloud.

@subsection User Authentication
@cindex Identification Protocol
@cindex identd
@cindex RFC 1413

NOTE: This feature is being implemented, however the current version
does not support it.

Speech Dispatcher does not provide any explicit authentication mechanism.  To
check the identity of users, Speech Dispatcher uses the Identification Protocol
mechanism defined by RFC 1413 to get the user's identity. 

@cindex user mapping
It is possible to specify user mapping in the configuration.  This allows
certain users to be considered the same and have the same rights (eg. to browse
their @ref{Message History}).

@node Text Transformation Tables (TTT), Message Priority Model, User Authentication, Features
@subsection Text Transformation Tables
@cindex TTT

The mechanism that Speech Dispatcher provides for processing
punctuation, capital letters, spelling or keys and characters,
is based on text tables mapping the required characters to some
text or a sound.

When Speech Dispatcher receives a command like @code{CHAR "a"},
it finds which table to use and according to it's content
produces either a some sound (.wav or .ogg) or some text
("ai", "alice", "acko", ...). All of this can be configured
through tables.

These tables, unless specified otherwise, are language-specific,
so that a user can specify different spelling rules for English
than for Czech or Italian.

@menu
* TTT Types::                   List of supported Text Transformation Tables.
@end menu

@node TTT Types,  , Text Transformation Tables (TTT), Text Transformation Tables (TTT)
@subsubsection TTT Types

There are currently 6 types of tables in Speech Dispatcher:

@itemize
@item Spelling (group @code{spelling})
This is used in spelling modes.

@item Punctuation (group @code{punctuation})
This is used in punctuation modes.

@item Capital Letter Recognition (group @code{cap_let_recogn})
This is used when capital letters recognition is set to spell the capital
letters.

@item Character (group @code{characters})
This is used when the client application wants to read a single
character, eg. when the user moves with cursor over text.

@item Key (group @code{keys})
This one is used when the user presses in keys, eg. when typing in some
text.

@item Sound icons (group @code{sound_icons})
These sound icons used to signal some events, e.g. end-of-line
or new-mail.
@end itemize

The user can set different tables for all of these situations, although
there is no need to and two or three tables for each language is enough.
For example the events Spelling, Punctuation and Character can be mapped
to the same table.

See @ref{Tables Configuration} to find out how to configure text
transformation tables.


@node Message Priority Model, Message History, Text Transformation Tables (TTT), Features
@subsection Message Priority Model
@cindex priorities

Speech Dispatcher can't synthesize everything that comes to it,
for the simple reason, that messages are often coming faster
than a synthetic voice can say them. On the screen of a
monitor, there is relatively a lot of space compared to
one-channel speech synthesis output. For this reason, we
use a system of several priorities targeted at different
types of messages.

@menu
* Priority Categories::         What are the available priorities.

* Examples of Using Priorities::  A few examples of using the priorities.
@end menu

@node Priority Categories, Priority Diagram, Message Priority Model, Message Priority Model
@subsubsection Priority Categories
                     
Speech Dispatcher provides the system of five priorities.
Every message will either contain explicit priority information,
or the default value will be considered.

Please see also the diagram bellow.

@subsubheading Priority @code{important}
@cindex Priority important

This message will be said immediately as it comes to server.
It is never interrupted. When several concurrent messages of
this priority are received by server, they are queued and said
in the order, they came.

When a new message of level @code{important} comes when a message of
another priority is spoken, this message is canceled. Other messages
of lower priorities are either postponed (priority @code{message} and
@code{text}) until there will be no messages of priority important
waiting or canceled (priority @code{notification} and @code{progress}.

These messages should be as short as possible and should rarely be
used, because they block the output of all other messages.

@subsubheading Priority @code{message}
@cindex Priority message

This message will be said when there is no message of priority
@code{important} or @code{message} waiting in the queue. If there are,
this message is postponed until the previous messages are spoken. This
means that the priority @code{message} doesn't interrupt itself. If
there are messages of priority @code{notification} and @code{progress}
waiting in the queue or being spoken when a message of priority
@code{message} comes, these are canceled.

@subsubheading Priority @code{text}
@cindex Priority text

This message will be said when there is no message of priority
@code{important} or @code{message} waiting in the queue. If there are,
this message is postponed until the previous messages are spoken.

The priority text interrupts itself. It means that if several messages
of this priority are received, they are not said in the order they
were received, but only the latest of them is said, others are
canceled.

If there are messages of priority @code{notification} and
@code{progress} waiting in the queue or being spoken when a message
of priority @code{message} comes, these are canceled.

@subsubheading Priority @code{notification}

This is a low priority message. If there are messages with priorities
@code{important}, @code{messages}, @code{text} or @code{progress}
waiting in the queues or being spoken, this @code{notification}
message is canceled.

This priority interrupts itself, so if more messages with priority
@code{notification} come at the same time, only the last of them is
spoken.

@subsubheading Priority @code{progress}

This is a special priority for messages that are coming
shortly one after each other and they carry the information
about some work in progress (e.g.@ @code{Completed 45%}).

If new messages interrupted each other (see priority
Notification), the user might not receive any complete
message.

This priority behaves the same as ``notification'' except
for 2 things:

@itemize
   @item The messages of this priority don't interrupt each other,
instead, a newly arriving message is canceled if another message is
being spoken.
  @item It tries to detect the last message of a series
of messages (It's important for the user to hear the @code{Completed
100%} message to know that the process has terminated). It waits until
there are no more messages of this priority waiting in queues and
if the last of them wasn't spoken yet, it speaks it with priority
@code{message}. 
@end itemize

This way, even if Speech Dispatcher is busy speaking messages of other
priorities, we are still sure that the important messages at the
end of the @code{progress} sequences will be said.

@subsubsection Access Rights
@cindex access rights

To protect privacy of users, Speech Dispatcher restricts history access to a
certain subset of all the received messages.  The following rules apply:

@itemize @bullet
@item
All the messages issued by a client connection are accessible to that
client connection.

@item
All the messages sent by a given user are accessible to that user.

@item
@cindex @code{speechd} user
@cindex @code{speechd} group
All the messages sent by the user @code{speechd} are accessible to all
users on the system running the Speech Dispatcher instance present in the
group @code{speechd}.

@item
No other messages are accessible.
@end itemize

Two users are considered the same, if and only if their connections originate
on the same host, their user names are the same, and their identity can be
checked, as described in @ref{User Authentication}.  If user's identity cannot
be checked, the user is considered different of all other connected or
previously connected users.

@node Multiple Output Modules,  , Message History, Features
@subsection Multiple Output Modules
@cindex output module
@cindex different synthesizers

Speech Dispatcher supports concurrent use of multiple output modules.  In the
case these output modules provide good synchronization, you can combine them in
reading messages.  For example if module1 can speak English and Czech while
module2 speaks only German, the idea is that if there is some message in
German, module2 is used, while module1 is used for the other languages.
However the language is not the only criteria for the decision.  The rules for
selection of an output module can be influenced through the configuration file
@file{speechd.conf}.

* Compiling a New Module ::     
@end menu

@node Compiling a New Module ,  , Multiple Output Modules, Multiple Output Modules
@subsubsection Compiling a New Module 

If you want to compile and use a new output module, you should place
it in @file{src/modules} in your source directory of Speech Dispatcher
and add it to @file{src/modules/Makefile.am}. You can compile and
install it by typing: @code{make; su root; make install}. The last
step you have to do is to let Speech Dispatcher know that you want to use
this new module by adding at least these two lines to
@file{speechd.conf} in your configuration directory.

@example
AddModule "module_name"
EndAddModule
@end example

and possibly also changing the lines

@example
DefaultModule new_module
@end example

tom make it default or

@example
LanguageDefaultModule "en"  "new_module"
@end example

to make it default for some language.

@node Output Modules Configuration, Tables Configuration, Configuration options, Configuration
@subsection Output Modules Configuration

Each user should turn on at least one output module in his
configuration, otherwise Speech Dispatcher won't be able to produce
any speech output.

Generally, the definition of output modules has this form:

@example
AddModule "module_name" 
          ...definition of voices...
          ...some parameters...
EndAddModule
@end example

The parameter @var{module_name} of @code{AddModule} is the name
of the output module. You should check if the plugin
@file{libsdmodule_name.so} is really installed in your
@file{lib/speechd/} directory. If the name is invalid,
no output module will be loaded and the parameters inside
this section will be ignored.

The parameters inside this block vary from one output module
to other. Each output module is different in some ways and has
different capabilities, so the options are also different.

However, there are several options which are common for some
output modules. Here is a short overview of them.

@table @code
@item AddVoice "@var{language}" "@var{symbolicname}" "@var{name}"

Each output module provides some voices and sometimes it even supports
different languages. For this reason, there is a common mechanism
how these can be defined in configuration, although, no module is
obligated to use it.

For each voice, there is exactly one @code{AddVoice} line.

@var{language} is the ISO language code of the language of this voice.

@var{symbolicname} is a symbolic name under which you wish this voice
to be available. See @ref{Standard Voices} for the list of names you can
use.

@var{name} is a name specific for the given output module. Please see
the comments in the configuration file under the appropriate AddModule
section for more info.

For example our current definition of voices for Festival
looks like this:

@example
        AddVoice        "en"    "male1"      "voice_kal_diphone"
        AddVoice        "en"    "male2"      "voice_ked_diphone"
        AddVoice        "en"    "male3"      "voice_rab_diphone"

        AddVoice        "es"    "male1"      "voice_el_diphone"
@end example

@item ModuleDelimiters "@var{delimiters}", ModuleMaxChunkLenght @var{lenght}

Normally, the output module doesn't try to synthesize all 
incoming text at once, but instead it cuts it into smaller
chunks (sentences, parts of sentences) and then synthesizes
them one by one. This second approach, used by some output
modules, is much faster, however it limits the ability of
the output module to provide good intonation.

For this reason, you can configure at which characters
(@var{delimiters}) the text should be cut in smaller blocks
or after how much characters (@var{lenght}) it should be cut,
if there is no @var{delimiter} found.

Making the two rules more strict, you will get better speed
but give away some quality of intonation. So for example
for slower computers, we recommend to include coma (,)
in @var{delimiters} so that the text is cut in parts
of sentences, while for faster computers, it's preferable
not to include coma and synthesize the whole composed
sentences.

The same applies to @code{MaxChunkLenght}, it's better
to set higher value for faster computers.

For example, curently the default for Festival is

@example
    FestivalMaxChunkLenght  300
    FestivalDelimiters  ".?!;,"
@end example

The output module may also decide to cut sentences on delimiters
only if they are followed by a space. This way for example
``file123.tmp'' would not be cut in two parts, but ``The horse
raced around the fence, that was lately painted green, fell.''
would be. (This is an interesting sentence, by the way.)

@end menu


@node Adding and choosing tables, Writing tables and modifying, Tables Configuration, Tables Configuration
@subsubsection Adding and Choosing Tables

Each table has a specific file and each of these files you want to use must
be loaded into Speech Dispatcher before it's possible to use it. It can be
done using this option in @file{speechd.conf}

@code{AddTable "@var{table_filename}"}

@var{table_filename} is the path to the desired table. It can be
either absolute or relative (to your @file{etc/speechd/} directory).

For example, the default English tables are loaded like this:

@example
AddTable        "en/spelling_short.conf"
AddTable        "en/spelling_long.conf"
AddTable        "en/sound_icons.conf"
AddTable        "en/keys.conf"
@end example

If you use tables for more languages, you must load them also, to be
able to use them.

Once the tables are loaded, you can specify which table should be
used in which mode by default. (They can be then changed by clients
at run-time). There are six configuration options
to do this.

@itemize
@item DefaultSpellingTable "@var{table}"
@item DefaultPunctuationTable "@var{table}"
@item DefaultCharacterTable "@var{table}"
@item DefaultCapLetRecognTable "@var{table}"
@item DefaultKeyTable "@var{table}"
@item DefaultSoundTable "@var{table}"
@end itemize

@var{table} is the name of the table specified in the file. Note that
this doesn't have to coincide with it's filename and also
it is language independent (the right table according to the
selected language will be chosen from available tables with
this name).

This is a valid definition of default tables:

@example
DefaultSpellingTable      "spelling_short"
DefaultPunctuationTable   "spelling_short"
DefaultCharacterTable     "spelling_short"
DefaultCapLetRecognTable  "spelling_short"
DefaultKeyTable           "keys"
DefaultSoundTable         "sound_icons"
@end example

Note that it's possible to use the same table for various modes.

@node Writing tables and modifying,  , Adding and choosing tables, Tables Configuration
@subsubsection Writing and Modifying Tables

In the header of each table, three things must be specified:

@table @code
@item language:@var{language_code}
@var{language_code} is the ISO code of the language this table is written for.

@item table:@var{table_name}
@var{table_name} is the name of the table. This allows you to have one
table split into more files or redefine some entries in an existing
table. If you are going to create a new table, chose some unique
name. If the table is specific for some application, prefix it's name
with the name of the application and an underscore
(eg. @code{emacs_sound_icons}).

@item group:@var{group_name}
Some tables, such as the spelling tables, are often also useful for other
things like punctuation or characters reading, however there is no use
for it in sound icons or keys reading, because the entries here have
different names and mean different things. You should specify here
in which groups this table can be used (if your table is specificly
designed for one thing, keep the group: list minimal). There
should be at least one entry.

@var{group_name} is the name of the group this table can be used
in.  See @ref{TTT Types}, for possible arguments.
@end table

Each header must be terminated with the string @code{definition:} on 
a separate line.

In @file{en/spelling_short.conf} we use this header

@example
language:en

table:spelling_short

group:spelling
group:characters
group:punctuation
group:cap_let_recogn

definition:
@end example

The definition of all the entries follow, each on one line, in this form:

@code{"name" = "@var{text}"}
or
@code{"name" = @var{path_to_sound_file}}

You can specify the @code{text} that should be synthesized for this
entry (in double quotes) or a @var{path_to_sound_file} that should
be played (without double quotes). This path can be either relative
(to the directory specified by the SoundDataDir option in configuration
or to your @file{usr/share/sounds/speechd} if SoundDataDir is not set)
or absolute. Currently supported sound files include .wav and
.ogg.

Examples are:

@example
"A"="capital ai"
"B"="capital b"

"warning" = "warning!"
"error" = error.ogg
"new-mail" = /usr/local/share/sounds/sound-library/notify-new-mail.wav

@chapter Client Programming

Clients communicate with Speech Dispatcher via the Speech Synthesis
Internet Protocol (SSIP).  The protocol is the actual interface to
Speech Dispatcher.

Usually you don't need to use SSIP directly.  You can use one of the
programming interfaces wrapping SSIP with programming library calls.  This is a
recommended way of communication with Speech Dispatcher.  We try so support as
many programming environments as possible.  This manual (except SSIP) contains
documentation for C and Python interface, however there are also other
interfaces developed as external projects.  Please contact us for information
about current external client libraries.

@node General Rules, SSIP Commands, SSIP, SSIP
@subsection General Rules

SSIP communicates with the clients through a defined set of text
commands, in the way usual in common Internet protocols.  The
characters sent to and from Speech Dispatcher are encoded using the UTF-8
encoding.

Each SSIP command, unless specified otherwise, consists of exactly one
line.  The line is sent in the following format:

@example
@var{command} @var{arg} ...
@end example

where @var{command} is a case insensitive command name and @var{arg}s
are its arguments separated by spaces.  The command arguments which
come from a defined set of values are case insensitive as well.  The
number of arguments is dependent on the particular command and there
can be commands having no arguments.

All lines of SSIP input and output must be ended with the pair of
carriage return and line feed characters, in this order.

When you connect to Speech Dispatcher, you should at least set your client
name, through the @code{SET SELF CLIENT_NAME} command (@pxref{Parameter Setting
Commands}).  This is important to get a proper identification of your client
--- to allow managing it from the control center application and to identify it
in a message history browser.  You might want to set other connection
parameters as well, look for more details in @ref{Parameter Setting Commands}.

Connection to Speech Dispatcher is preferably closed by issuing the
@code{QUIT} command, see @ref{Other Commands}.

SSIP is a synchronous protocol --- you send commands and only after a
complete response from SSIP arrives back you are allowed to send the
next command.  Usually, the connection to Speech Dispatcher remains open
during the whole run of the particular client application.  If you
close the connection and open it again, you must set all the
previously set parameters again, Speech Dispatcher doesn't store session
parameters between connections.

The protocol allows you to perform commands regarding other currently
connected or previously connected clients.  This allows you to write a
control application managing or browsing all the messages received by
the current Speech Dispatcher process.  The mechanism is completely
relaxed, there are no restrictions on managing some aspects of 
sound output of other users, however, there is a mechanism
to prevent one user from seeing history messages of another
user. @xref{Access Rights}.

Some of the commands (@ref{Speech Output Control Commands}
and @ref{Parameter Setting Commands})
take an argument in the form:
@example
        @{ @var{id} | all | self @}
@end example 

where the value can be the @code{id} of the connection the command should
be performed on (a positive number), the string @code{all} to
act on all clients of this server or @code{self} to act on the connection
itself. Unless you are writing a special client for managing
Speech Dispatcher or unless you have specific needs, you
should only use the @code{self} value of this argument.

Not all parameter setting commands may receive all kinds of the first
parameter defined above, for instance, some of them may receive only
@code{self}.

SSIP replies of Speech Dispatcher are of the following format:

@example
@var{ccc}-line 1
@var{ccc}-line 2
...
@var{ccc}-line @var{n}-1
@var{ddd} line @var{n}
@end example

where @var{n} is a positive integer, and @var{ccc} and @var{ddd} are
three-digit long numeric codes identifying the result of the command.
The last line determines the overall result of the command, the result
code is followed by an English message describing the result of the
action in a human readable form.

@node SSIP Commands, Return Codes, General Rules, SSIP
@subsection SSIP Commands

Commands recognized by SSIP can be divided into several groups: Speech
synthesis and sound output commands, speech control commands,
parameter setting commands, commands retrieving information about
current client and server settings, command handling the message
history, and other commands.  Each of these command groups is
described in one of the following sections.

In the command descriptions, the command is written together with its
arguments.  Optional arguments are enclosed by square brackets
(@code{[} and @code{]}), alternatives are separated by the vertical
rule (@code{|}) and are grouped within braces (@code{@{} and
@code{@}}) or square brackets for mandatory or optional arguments
respectively, literal arguments values are typeset in lower letters
(they are case insensitive), and variable arguments are typeset
@var{like this}.  Ellipsis denoted by three dots (@code{...}) means
repetition (zero or more times) of all the arguments within the
current brackets.

@node Speech Synthesis and Sound Output Commands, Speech Output Control Commands, SSIP Commands, SSIP Commands
@subsubsection Speech Synthesis and Sound Output

These commands invoke actual output to particular output device.  The
particular way how the message is handled depands on current speech
parameter settings and Speech Dispatcher configuration (@pxref{Configuration}).

@table @code
@item SPEAK
Start receiving a text message and synthesize it.  After sending a
reply to the command, Speech Dispatcher waits for the text of the
message.  The text can spread over any number of lines and is
finished by an end of line marker followed by the line containing the
single character @code{.} (dot).  Thus the complete character sequence
closing the input text is @code{CR LF . CR LF}.  If any line within
the sent text starts with a dot, an extra dot is prepended before it.

During reception of the text message, Speech Dispatcher doesn't send
response to the particular lines sent.  The response line is sent only
immediately after the @code{SPEAK} command and after receiving the
closing dot line.

Speech Dispatcher can start speech synthesis as soon as a sufficient
amount of the text arrives, it generally needn't (but may) wait until
the end of data marker is received.

There is no explicit upper limit on the size of the text, but the
server administrator may set one in the configuration or the limit can
be enforced by available system resources.  If the limit is exceeded,
the whole text is accepted, but its exceeding part is ignored and an
error response code is returned after processing the final dot line.

@item CHAR @var{char}
Speak letter @var{char}.  @var{char} can be any character
representable by the UTF-8 encoding. The only exception
is the character space (@code{ }) that can't be sent
directly. In this case, a string @code{space} must be
sent instead.

@example
CHAR e
CHAR \
CHAR space
CHAR &
@end example

This command is intended to be used for speaking single letters,
e.g.@ when reading a character under cursor or when spelling words.

@item KEY @var{key-name}
Speak key identified by @var{key-name}.  The command is intended to be
used for speaking keys pressed by the user.

@var{key-name} is a case sensitive symbolic key name.  It is composed
of a key name, optionally prepended with one or more prefixes, each
containing an auxiliary key name and the underscore character.

Key name may contain any character excluding control characters (the
characters in the range 0 to 31 in the ASCII table, characters in the
range 128 to 159 in the Latin-* tables and other ``invisible''
characters), spaces, underscores, and double quotes.

The recognized key names are:

@itemize
@item
Any single UTF-8 character, excluding the exceptions defined above.

@item
Any of the symbolic key names defined in @ref{Key Names}.
@end itemize

Examples of valid key names:

@example
a
A
shift_a
shift_A
@'{u}
$
enter
shift_kp-enter
control_alt_delete
control
@end example

@item SOUND_ICON @var{icon-name}
Send a sound identified by @var{icon-name} to the audio output.
@var{icon-name} is a symbolic name of the given sound from the
standard set listed in @ref{Standard Sound Icons}, or another name
from the particular Speech Dispatcher sound icon configuration.
@end table

@node Speech Output Control Commands, Blocks of Messages Commands, Speech Synthesis and Sound Output Commands, SSIP Commands
@subsubsection Controlling Speech Output

These commands can stop or resume speech or audio output.  They all
affect only the synthesis process and output to a sound device, they
do not affect the message history.

@table @code
@item STOP @{ @var{id} | all | self @}
Immediately stop outputting the current message (whatever it is ---
text, letter, key, or sound icon) from the identified client, if any
is being output.  If the command argument is @code{self}, last message
from the current client connection is stopped.  If it is @code{all},
stop currently output message or messages from all the clients.
Otherwise, argument @var{id} must be given as an positive integer and
the currently processed message from the client connection identified
by @var{id} is stopped; if there is none such, do nothing.

@item CANCEL @{ @var{id} | all | self @}
This command is the same as @code{SPEAK}, with the exception that it
stops not yet output messages as well.  All currently queued messages
are stored into the message history without being sent to the audio
output device.

@item PAUSE @{ @var{id} | all | self @}
Stop audio output immediately, but do not discard anything.  All the
currently output and currently or later queued messages are postponed
and saved for later processing, until the corresponding @code{RESUME}
command is received.

The meaning of the command arguments is the same as in the @code{STOP}
command.

@item RESUME @{ @var{id} | all | self @}
Cancel the effect of the previously issued @code{PAUSE} command.
Note that messages of the priority ``progress'' and ``notification'' received during
the pause are not output (but they remain stored in the message history).

It is an error to send the @code{RESUME} command when the output
corresponding to the given argument is not paused by a previous
invocation of the @code{PAUSE} command.  Such an error is signaled by
a @code{4XX} return code.

The meaning of the command arguments is the same as in the @code{STOP}
command.
@end table

@node Blocks of Messages Commands, Parameter Setting Commands, Speech Output Control Commands, SSIP Commands
@subsubsection Blocks of Messages Commands

Block commands allow the client to concatenate several messages to form one
block that behaves as one message in the priority system and history. After
opening the block, client can send a specified subset of the commands and
the messages introduced by @code{SPEAK} will be processed immediately, however
there will be no priority interaction before closing the block.
The @ref{Speech Output Control Commands} also handle the whole block as one
message.

Take for example this message taken from an email client:

@example
> Hi, how are you?
I'm fine. Thank you.
@end example

The character `>' clearly marks who said which part. So it'd be nice to say
the two lines with different voices, however, it'd be desirable to treat it all
as one message with priority TEXT and have it put together in history,
because in fact, it logically @emph{is} one message.

@table @code
@item BLOCK BEGIN
Opens a block of messages. There will be no priority interaction between
the messages inside the block, the whole block will be treated as one message
of the priority that was specified by previous @code{SET} command.

It can be only called outside of a block, nesting is not allowed.

@itemize
The allowed commands inside a block are:
        @item @code{SPEAK}
        @item @code{SOUND_ICON}
        @item @code{SET SELF RATE}
        @item @code{SET SELF PITCH}
        @item @code{SET SELF VOICE}
        @item @code{SET SELF LANGUAGE}

        @item @code{QUIT}
@end itemize

@item BLOCK END
Closes a block of messages, see @code{BLOCK BEGIN}.

It can be only called inside a block opened by @code{BLOCK BEGIN},
nesting is not allowed.
@end table

@end example

@node Parameter Setting Commands, Information Retrieval Commands, Blocks of Messages Commands, SSIP Commands
@subsubsection Parameter Setting

The @code{SET} command sets various control parameters of Speech
Dispatcher.  The parameter is always denoted by the second command
argument.

All the settings take effect on the connections specified in the first
argument (@pxref{General Rules}) and until the parameter setting is
changed by another invocation of the appropriate @code{SET} command or
until the connection is closed.

@table @code
@item SET self CLIENT_NAME @var{user}:@var{client}:@var{component}
Set client's name.  Client name consists of the user name, client
(application) identification, and the identification of the component
of the client (application).  Each of the parts of the client name may
contain only alphanumeric characters.

For example, for a client called @code{lynx} that creates Speech
Dispatcher connection for its command processing, the name could be set in
the following way:

@example
SET CLIENT_NAME joe:lynx:cmd_processing
@end example

The client name is used in the server configuration settings, client
listings and message history handling.  All its three parts can be
arbitrary, but it's important to define and follow rules for each
application supporting Speech Dispatcher, so that a Speech Dispatcher user can
configure all the aspects of the speech output easily.

Usually, this command should be sent as the very first command when a
new connection to Speech Dispatcher is established.  The command may be
sent only once within a single connection, attempts to change the
client's name once it's already set are answered with an error code.

Only @code{self} is allowed as the `target' argument.

@item SET @{ all | self | @var{id} @} LANGUAGE @var{language}
Set recommended language for this client to @var{language}.
@var{language} is the name of the language according to RFC 1766.

For example, to set the preferred language to Czech, you send the
following command:

@example
SET SELF LANGUAGE cs
@end example

@item SET self PRIORITY @var{n}
Set message priority to @var{n}.  @var{n} must be one of the values
@code{important}, @code{text}, @code{message}, @code{notification},
@code{progress}.  @xref{Message Priority Model}.

Only @code{self} is allowed as the `target' argument.

@item SET @{ all | self | @var{id} @} PUNCTUATION @{ all | some | none @}
Set punctuation mode to the given value.  @code{all} means read all
punctuation characters, @code{none} read no punctuation characters,
@code{some} means read only punctuation characters given in the
server configuration or defined by the client's last @code{SET
IMPORTANT_PUNCTUATION} command.

@item SET @{ all | self | @var{id} @} IMPORTANT_PUNCTUATION @var{chars}
Set punctuation characters read when @code{SET PUNCTUATION some} is
set to those in @var{chars}.  @var{chars} is a sequence of the
required characters, without any spaces.  @var{char} may not contain
control characters and may not begin with double quotes.

@item SET @{ all | self | @var{id} @} @var{table} @var{name}
There are various tables, to allow customization of spelling,
punctuation and other text transformation features.  There are
standard tables defined internally (such as @ref{Standard Spelling
Tables} or @ref{Standard Sound Tables}) or you can define your own
tables and add them to Speech Dispatcher through configuration.

@var{table} must be one of the table identifiers listed below:

@itemize @bullet
@item @code{PUNCTUATION_TABLE}
@item @code{SPELLING_TABLE}
@item @code{TEXT_TABLE}
@item @code{SOUND_TABLE}
@item @code{CHARACTER_TABLE}
@item @code{KEY_TABLE}
@item @code{CAP_LET_RECOGN_TABLE}
@end itemize

@var{name} must be one of table names returned to the corresponding
@code{LIST} command (@pxref{Information Retrieval Commands}).

@item SET @{ all | self | @var{id} @} VOICE @var{name}
Set the voice identified by @var{name}.  @var{name} must be one of the voice
identifiers returned by the command @code{LIST VOICES} (@pxref{Information
Retrieval Commands}).

There is a standard set of voice identifiers defined in @ref{Standard
Voices}.

@item SET @{ all | self | @var{id} @} RATE @var{n}
Set the rate of speech.  @var{n} is an integer value within the range
from -100 to 100, with 0 corresponding to the default rate of the
current speech synthesis output module, lower values meaning slower
speech and higher values meaning faster speech.

@item SET @{ all | self | @var{id} @} PITCH @var{n}
Set the pitch of speech.  @var{n} is an integer value within the range
from -100 to 100, with 0 corresponding to the default pitch of the
current speech synthesis output module, lower values meaning lower
pitch and higher values meaning higher pitch.

@item SET @{ all | self | @var{id} @} CAP_LET_RECOGN @{ none | spell | icon @}
Set capital letters recognition mode. @code{none} switches this
feature off. @code{spell} causes that capital letters are spelled
in the output using the table set as @code{CAP_LET_RECOGN_TABLE}.
With parameter @code{icon}, each capital letter will be preceeded
by a sound icon (either sound or textual) specified by the user
in his configuration.

@item SET @{ all | self | @var{id} @} HISTORY @{ on | off @}
Enable (@code{on}) or disable (@code{off}) storing of received
messages into history.

This command is intended for use by message history browsers and
usually should not be used by other kinds of clients.
@end table

@node Information Retrieval Commands, History Handling Commands, Parameter Setting Commands, SSIP Commands
@subsubsection ReTrieving Information

The @code{LIST} command serves for retrieving information that can be
presented to the user for selection of the values to the @code{SET}
command.  The information listed is selected according to the first
argument of the @code{LIST} command.

@table @code
@item LIST SPELLING_TABLES
List the names of all the text spelling tables available on the
server.  Each table name is listed on a separate line.  Each name may
contain only alphanumeric characters and underscores.

Example Speech Dispatcher response:

@example
200-sptable2
200-sptable1
200-sptable4
200-special_table
200 OK Tables listed.
@end example

The standard sound tables are listed only if they are mapped
to some real table.  @xref{Standard Sound Tables}.

@item LIST PUNCTUATION_TABLES
Similar to @code{LIST SPELLING_TABLES}, but lists the names of the
available punctuation spelling tables.

@item LIST TEXT_TABLES
Similar to @code{LIST SPELLING_TABLES}, but lists the names of the
available text mapping tables.

@item LIST SOUND_TABLES
Similar to @code{LIST SPELLING_TABLES}, but lists the names of the
available sound mapping tables.

The standard sound tables are listed only if they are mapped
to some real table.  @xref{Standard Sound Tables}.

@item LIST CHARACTER_TABLES
Similar to @code{LIST SPELLING_TABLES}, but lists the names of the
available character spelling tables.

@item LIST KEY_TABLES
Similar to @code{LIST SPELLING_TABLES}, but lists the names of the
available key description tables.

@item LIST CAP_LET_RECOGN_TABLES
Similar to @code{LIST SPELLING_TABLES}, but lists the names of the
tables available for use with capital recognition.


@item LIST VOICES
Similar to @code{LIST SPELLING_TABLES}, but lists the available voice
names.

The standard voices are always listed.  @xref{Standard Voices}.
@end table

@node History Handling Commands, Other Commands, Information Retrieval Commands, SSIP Commands
@subsubsection History Handling

History is handled by the @code{HISTORY} command.  It can take many
forms, described below, that allow browsing, retrieving and repeating
stored messages.  In each invocation of the @code{HISTORY} command
there is no difference between processing spoken or not spoken
messages, all the received messages are processed.

There can be @dfn{history cursor} pointing on some message in the
history.  You can move it across history messages and retrieve the
message the cursor is pointing to, using the @code{HISTORY CURSOR} set
of command arguments described below.

@table @code
@item HISTORY GET CLIENT_LIST
List known client names, their identifiers and status.  Each connection is
listed on a separate line in the following format:

@example
@var{id} @var{name} @var{status}
@end example

where @var{id} is a client id that can be used in other history
handling requests or in the speech output control commands
(@pxref{Speech Output Control Commands}), @var{name} is the client
name as set through the @code{SET SELF CLIENT_NAME} command, and
@var{status} is @code{1} for connected clients and @code{0} for
disconnected clients.  @var{id}s are unique within a single run of
Speech Dispatcher.

Sample reply of Speech Dispatcher:

@example
240-0 joe:speechd_client:main 0
240-1 joe:speechd_client:status 0
240-2 unknown:unknown:unknown 1
240 OK CLIENTS LIST SENT
@end example

@item HISTORY GET CLIENT_ID
Return id of the client itself.

The id is listed on a separate line in the following format:

@example
@var{id}
@end example

Example:
@example
200-123
200 OK CLIENT ID SENT
@end example

@item HISTORY GET CLIENT_MESSAGES @{ @var{id} | all | self @} @var{start} @var{number}
List identifiers of messages sent by the client identified by
@var{id}.  If the special identifier @code{all} is used, identifiers
of messages sent by all clients are listed; if the special identifier
@code{self} is used, identifiers of messages sent by this client are
listed.

@var{number} of messages is listed, starting from the message numbered
@var{start}.  Both @var{number} and @var{start} must be positive
integers.  The first message is numbered 1, the second 2, etc.  If the
given range exceeds the range of available messages, no error is
signaled and the given range is restricted to the available range of
messages.

Messages are sorted by the criterion used in the last client's
invocation of the @code{HISTORY SORT} command.  If no @code{HISTORY
SET} has been invoked yet, the messages are sorted from the oldest to
the newest, according to their time of arrival to Speech Dispatcher.

Each message id is listed, together with other information, on a
separate line, in the following format:

@example
@var{id} @var{client-id} @var{client-name} "@var{time}" @var{priority} "@var{intro}"
@end example

@var{client-id} is a numeric identifier of the client which sent the
message, @var{client-name} is its name as set by the @code{SET SELF
CLIENT_NAME} command (@pxref{Parameter Setting Commands}).
@var{time} is the time of arrival of the message, in the fixed length
@code{YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS} format.  @var{priority} is the priority of
the message, one of the values accepted by the @code{SET SELF PRIORITY}
command (@pxref{Parameter Setting Commands}).

@var{intro} is the introductory part of the message of a certain
maximum length, see the @code{HISTORY SET SHORT_MESSAGE_LENGTH}
command.  @var{intro} does not contain any double quotes nor the line
feed character.

All the message identifiers in the history, regardless of clients that
issued them, are unique within a single run of Speech Dispatcher and
remain unchanged.

@item HISTORY GET LAST
List the id of the last message sent by the client.

The id is listed on a separate line of the following format:

@example
@var{id}
@end example

If the client haven't sent any message yet, return an error code.

@item HISTORY GET MESSAGE @var{id}
Return the text of the history message identified by @var{id}.  If
@var{id} doesn't refer any message, return an error code instead.
The text is sent as a multi-line message, with no escaping or special
transformation.

An example SSIP response to the command:

@example
200-Hello, world!
200-How are you?
200 OK MESSAGE SENT
@end example

@item HISTORY CURSOR GET
Get the id of the message the history cursor is pointing on.

The id is listed on a separate line.  Sample Speech Dispatcher reply to
this command:

@example
243-42
243 OK CURSOR POSITION RETURNED
@end example

@item HISTORY CURSOR SET @{ @var{id} | all | self @} @{ first | last | pos @var{n} @}
Set the history cursor to the given position.  The meaning of the
first argument after @code{SET} is the same as in the @code{HISTORY
GET CLIENT_MESSAGES} command.  The argument @code{first} asks to set
the cursor on the first position and the argument @code{last} asks to
set the cursor on the last position of the history of the given
client.  If the argument @code{pos} is used, the position is set to
@var{n}, where @var{n} is a positive integer.  It is an error if
@var{id} doesn't identify any client or if @var{n} doesn't point to
any existing position in the history.

As for the order and numbering of the messages in the history, the
same rules apply as in @code{HISTORY GET CLIENT_MESSAGES}, see above.

@item HISTORY CURSOR @{ forward | backward @}
Move the cursor one position @code{forward}, resp. @code{backward},
within the messages of the client specified in the last @code{HISTORY
CURSOR SET} command.  If there is no next, resp. previous, message,
don't move the cursor and return an error code.

@item HISTORY SAY @var{id}
Speak the message from history identified by @var{id}.  If @var{id}
doesn't refer any message, return an error code instead.

The message is spoken as it would be sent by its originating command
(@code{SPEAK} or @code{SOUND_ICON}), but the @emph{current} settings
(priority, etc.) apply.

@item HISTORY SORT @{ asc | desc @} @{ time | user | client_name | priority | message_type @}
Sort the messages in history according to the given criteria.  If the
second command argument is @code{asc}, sort in the ascending order, if
it is @code{desc}, sort in the descending order.  The third command
argument specifies the message property to order by:

@table @code
@item time
Time of arrival of the message.

@item user
User name.

@item client_name
Client name, excluding user name.

@item priority
Priority.

@item message_type
Type of the message (text, sound icon, character, key), in the order
specified in the Speech Dispatcher configuration or by the @code{HISTORY
SET MESSAGE_TYPE_ORDERING} command.
@end table

The sorting is stable --- order of all the messages that are equal in
the given ordering remains the same.

The sorting is specific to the given client connection, other
connections are unaffected by invocation of this command.

@item HISTORY SET SHORT_MESSAGE_LENGTH @var{length}
Set the maximum length of short versions of history messages to
@var{length} characters.  @var{length} must be a non-negative integer.

Short (truncated) versions of history messages are used e.g. in the
answer to the @code{HISTORY GET CLIENT_MESSAGES} format.

@item HISTORY SET MESSAGE_TYPE_ORDERING "@var{ordering}"
Set the ordering of the message types, from the minimum to the
maximum.  @var{ordering} is a sequence of the following symbols,
separated by spaces: @code{text}, @code{sound_icon}, @code{char},
@code{key}.  The symbols are case insensitive and each of them must be
present in @var{ordering} exactly once.

The specified ordering can be used by the @code{HISTORY SORT} command.

@item HISTORY SEARCH @{ @var{id} | all | self @} "@var{condition}"
Return the list of history messages satisfying @var{condition}.  The
command allows searching messages by given words.  The output format
is the same as of the @code{HISTORY GET CLIENT_MESSAGES} command.

The meaning of the first argument after @code{SEARCH} is the same as
in the @code{HISTORY GET CLIENT_MESSAGES} command.

@var{condition} is constructed according to the following grammar
rules:

@table @code
@item @var{condition} :: @var{word}
Matches messages containing @var{word}.

@item @var{condition} :: ( ! @var{condition} )
Negation of the given condition.

@item @var{condition} :: ( @var{condition} [ & @var{condition} ... ] )
Logical AND --- all the conditions must be satisfied.

@item @var{condition} :: ( @var{condition} [ | @var{condition} ... ] )
Logical OR --- at least one of the conditions must be satisfied.
@end table

Spaces within the condition are insignificant and ignored.

The following rules apply to @var{word}s:

@itemize @minus
@item
@var{word} is a sequence of adjacent alphanumeric characters.

@item
If @var{word} contains any upper-case letter, the search for the word
is case sensitive, otherwise it's case insensitive.

@item
@var{word} must match whole word, not only its substring.

@item
@var{word} can contain the wild card characters @code{?}, substituting
any single alphanumeric character, and @code{*}, substituting any
number (incl. zero) of alphanumeric characters.
@end itemize

Returned messages are sorted by the following rules:

@enumerate
@item
The primary sorting is defined by the number of the satisfied
subconditions on the top level of the given condition, from the
highest (best matching messages first) to the lowest.  This takes any
effect only if the given condition is the OR rule.

@item
The criterion used in the last client's invocation of the
@code{HISTORY SORT} command.  If no @code{HISTORY SORT} has been
invoked yet, the messages are sorted from the oldest to the newest,
according to their time of arrival to Speech Dispatcher.
@end enumerate
@end table

@node Return Codes, Sample SSIP Relation, SSIP Commands, SSIP
@subsection Return Codes

Each line of the SSIP output starts with a three-digit numeric code of
the form @var{NXX} where @var{N} determines the result group and
@var{xx} denotes the finer classification of the result.

SSIP defines the following result groups:

@table @var
@item 1xx
Informative response --- general information about the protocol, help
messages.

@item 2xx
Operation was completely successful.

@item 3xx
Server error, problem on the server side.

@item 4xx
Client error, invalid arguments or parameters received.

@item 5xx
Client error, invalid command syntax, unparseable input.
@end table

Result groups @var{1xx} and @var{2xx} correspond to successful
actions, other groups to unsuccessful actions.  Only the groups
defined here may be returned from the Speech Dispatcher.

Currently, only the meaning of the first digit of the result code is
defined, the last two digits are insignificant and can be of any
value.  Clients shouldn't rely on the unspecified digits in any way.
If you are going to write your own SSIP implementation, please consult
the authors of Speech Dispatcher to define more precise set of return
codes.

@node Sample SSIP Relation,  , Return Codes, SSIP
@subsection Example of an SSIP Relation

The following example illustrates a sample relation with SSIP.  The
client connects to the Speech Dispatcher, sets all the common parameters,
sends two text messages, displays the list of clients, instructs
Speech Dispatcher to repeat the second message, and closes the connection.
Lines starting with a numeric code are response lines of the server,
other lines are the lines sent by the client.

@example
SET SELF CLIENT_NAME joe:vi:default
208 OK CLIENT NAME SET

@subsection Initializing and Terminating

@deffn {C API function}  int spd_open(char* client_name, char* connection_name, char* user_name)
@findex spd_open()

Opens a new connection to Speech Dispatcher and returns a socket file descriptor you will
use to communicate with Speech Dispatcher. It's one of the parameter of all the others
functions.

The three parameters @code{client_name}, @code{connection_name} and @code{username}
are there only for informational and navigational purpose, they don't affect
any settings or behavior of any functions. The authentication mechanism
has nothing to do with @code{username}. These parameters are important for
the user when he wants to set some parameters for a given session, when he
wants to browse through history, etc.

@code{client_name} is the name of the client that opens the connection. Normally,
it should be the name of the executable, for example ``lynx'', ``emacs'', ``bash'',
or ``gcc''. It can't be left to NULL.

@code{connection_name} determines the particular use of that connection. If you
use only one connection in your program, this should be set to ``main'' (passing
a NULL pointer has the same effect). If you use two or more connections in
your program, their @code{client_name}s should be the same, but @code{connection_name}s
should differ. For example: ``buffer'', ``command_line'', ``text'', ``menu''.

@code{username} should be set to the name of the user. Normally, you should
get this string from the system. If set to NULL, libspeechd will try to
determine it automatically by g_get_user_name().

It returns the file descriptor of the created connection on success, 0 on error.

Each connection you open should be closed by spd_close() before the end of the program.

@end deffn

@deffn {C API function}  void spd_close(int connection)
@findex spd_close()

Closes a Speech Dispatcher socket connection. You should close every connection
before the end of your program.

@code{connection} is the file descriptor obtained by spd_open().
@end deffn

@node Speech Synthesis Commands in C, Speech output control commands in C, Initializing and Terminating in C, C API
@subsection Speech Synthesis Commands

@deffn {C API function}  int spd_say(int connection, char* priority, char* text);
@findex spd_say()

Sends a message to Speech Dispatcher. If this message isn't blocked by some message
of higher priority and this CONNECTION isn't paused, it will be synthesized
directly on some of the output devices. Otherwise, the message will be discarded
or delayed according to it's priority.

@code{connection} is the file descriptor obtained by spd_open().

@code{priority} is a NULL terminated string with the name
of the priority. @xref{Message Priority Model}.

@code{text} is a null terminated string containing text you want to sent to
synthesis. It must be encoded in UTF-8. Note that this doesn't have to be what
you will finally hear. It can be affected by different settings as spelling,
punctuation, text substitution etc.

It returns 0 on success, -1 otherwise.

@end deffn

@deffn {C API function}  int spd_sayf(int connection, char* priority, char* format, ...);
@findex spd_sayf()

Similar to @code{spd_say()}, simulates the behavior of printf().

@code{format} is a string containing text and format of the parameters, like ``%d'',
``%s'' etc. It must be encoded in UTF-8.

@code{...} is an arbitrary number of arguments.

All other parameters are the same as for spd_say().

For example:
@example
       spd_sayf(conn, "text", ``Hello %s, how are you?'', username);
       spd_sayf(conn, "important", ``Fatal error on [%s:%d]'', filename, line);
@end example

But be careful! For example this doesn't work:

@example
       spd_sayf(conn, "notification", ``Pressed key is %c.'', key);
@end example

Why? Because you are supposing that key is a char, but that will
fail with languages using amplified charsets. The proper solution
is:

@example
       spd_sayf(conn, "notification", ``Pressed key is %s'', key);
@end example
where key is a encode string.

It returns 0 on succes, -1 otherwise.

@subsection Speech Output Control Commands

@subsubheading Stop Commands

@deffn {C API function}  int spd_stop(int connection);
@findex spd_stop()

Stops the message currently being spoken on a given connection. If there
is no message being spoken, does nothing. (It doesn't touch the messages
waiting in queues). This is intended for stops executed by the user,
not for automatic stops (because automatically, you can't control
how many messages are still waiting in queues on the server).

@code{connection} is the file descriptor obtained by spd_open().

It returns 0 on succes, -1 otherwise.
@end deffn

@deffn {C API function}  int spd_stop_all(int connection);
@findex spd_stop_all()

The same as spd_stop(), but it stops every message being said,
without distinguishing where it came from.

It returns 0 on succes, -1 if some of the stops failed.
@end deffn

@deffn {C API function}  int spd_stop_uid(int connection, int target_uid);
@findex spd_stop_uid()

The same as spd_stop() except that it stops some other client than
the calling one. You must specify this client in @code{target_uid}.

@code{target_uid} is the unique ID of the connection you want
to execute stop() on. It can be obtained from spd_history_get_client_list().
@xref{History Commands in C}.

It returns 0 on succes, -1 otherwise.

@end deffn

@subsubheading Cancel Commands

@deffn {C API function}  int spd_cancel(int connection);

Stops the currently spoken message from this connection
(if there is any) and discard all the queued messages
from this connection. This is probably what you want
to do, when you call spd_cancel() automatically in
your program.
@end deffn

@deffn {C API function}  int spd_cancel_all(int connection);
@findex spd_cancel_all()

The same as spd_cancel(), but it cancels every message
without distinguishing where it came from.

It returns 0 on succes, -1 if some of the stops failed.
@end deffn

@deffn {C API function}  int spd_cancel_uid(int connection, int target_uid);
@findex spd_cancel_uid()

The same as spd_cancel() except that it executes cancel for some other client
than the calling one. You must specify this client in @code{target_uid}.

@code{target_uid} is the unique ID of the connection you want to
execute cancel() on.  It can be obtained from
spd_history_get_client_list().  @xref{History Commands in C}.

It returns 0 on succes, -1 otherwise.
@end deffn

@subsubheading Pause Commands

@deffn {C API function}  int spd_pause(int connection);
@findex int spd_pause()

Pauses all messages received from the given connection. No messages
except for priority @code{notification} and @code{progress} all threw away,
they are all waiting in
a separate queue for resume(). The message that was being said
in the moment pause() was received will be continued from the place
where it was paused.

To be able to guarantee this, we had to define this function
as blocking. On some devices, it can return immediately
while on some others, it can return after a short period
of time, for example after some sentence is synthesized till
the end.

This shouldn't be any problem. User executes a pause, he waits
a short time till the end of the sentence, than he can do what
he wants and when he return, resume() is sent and Speech Dispatcher
will continue saying the message without any loss of information.

Never suppose this function doesn't block, even if on your
output device it doesn't.

When pause is on for the given client, all newly received
messages are also queued and waiting for resume().

It returns 0 on succes, -1 if something failed.
@end deffn

@deffn {C API function}  int spd_pause_all(int connection);

TODO: This is very messy. Something like that should be somewhere, but
not here and not in this form.

@dfn{Server side} is the side where Speech Dispatcher operates. It
means server core, output modules and partly SSIP which is the layer
for communication between server side and client side.

@dfn{Client side} is where particular applications wanting to speak
are, where the shared library implementing public API is
located and partly SSIP which is the layer
for communication between server side and client side.

@dfn{Client} means an application that wants to speak or an application
that is used to control Speech Dispatcher. (Of course different combinations
are possible.)

@dfn{Server Core} is the central part of Speech Dispatcher composed of
two threads. One is listening on the user socket, parsing and proceeding
incoming commands, and saving incoming text to queues. The other thread
takes messages from queues and sends them to appropriate synthesizers.

@dfn{Output module} is a backend of Speech Dispatcher in the form of plug-in.
It takes care of communication with the particular synthesizer and provides
only abstract functions to the server core.

@dfn{Shared library} or @dfn{Public API} is a front-end of Speech Dispatcher
that provides polished functions programmers should
use to send commands to the server.

@dfn{SSIP} is the layer (communication protocol) between server side
(server core) and client side (shared library). It stands for Speech
Synthesis Internet Protocol.

@dfn{Socket} or @dfn{File descriptor} represents the particular connection
between a client and server. In C, it's and integer variable.

Output modules for Speech Dispatcher have the form of glib plug-ins
(dynamically loaded libraries) located in src/modules/. They
should have a firm structure, contain all the required functions
and data structures.

@subsection Basic Structure

The heart of each output module is this structure:

@example
typedef struct@{
    gchar    *name;
    gchar    *description;
    GModule  *gmodule;
    gint     (*write)       (gchar *, size_t, TFDSetElement*);
    gint     (*stop)        (void);
    size_t   (*pause)       (void);
    gint     (*is_speaking) (void);
    gint     (*close)       (void);
    SPDModuleSettings settings;
@}OutputModule;
@end example

Each output module fills in some of the items (e.g. name and description, function
calls pointers) on module_load() and then Speech Dispatcher provides the rest
(gmodule, settings). After module_init(), this structure is fully working and
Speech Dispatcher will communicate with the output module only through
this simple interface. So you can see what are the functions each new
output module must implement, nothing else is necessary.

To be able to load the output module, two additional functions must
be present in it's code:

@example
OutputModule* module_load(configoption_t **options, int *num_options);
int module_init(void);
@end example

They are discussed in more detail in the section @ref{How to Write New Output
Module}.

@node How to Write New Output Module, Output Module Functions, Basic Structure, Output Modules
@subsection How to Write New Output Module
We will recommend here a basic structure of the code for an output module
you should follow, although it's perfectly ok to establish your own if
you have reasons to do so, if all the necessary functions and data are
defined somewhere in the file. For this purpose, we will use examples
from the output module for Flite (Festival Lite), so it's recommended
to keep looking at @code{flite.c} for reference.

A few rules you should respect:
@itemize
        @item Everything is declared as @code{static} except where explicitly desired to be otherwise.
        @item If one or more new threads are used in the output module, they must block all signals.
        @item On module_close(), all lateral threads and processes should be terminated,
all memmory freed. Don't suppose module_close() is allways called before exit()
and the sources will be freed automatically.
        @item All of the functions and macros you define should have prefix module_
        @item We will be happy if all the copyrights are assigned to Brailcom, o.p.s.
in order for us to be in a better legal position against possible intruders.
@end itemize

The basic structure OutputModule is defined in @file{intl/modules.h}
and therefore this header must be included in every plug-in source code.

@example
#include "modules.h"
@end example

Also one other file called @file{intl/fdset.h} where the TFDSetElement
structure is defined must be included to be able to handle the
different speech synthesis settings.

@example
#include "fdset.h"
@end example

Additionally, it's also reccomended to include @code{module_utils.c}
which provides many tools to help writing output modules
and make the code simpler.

Definition of macros @code{MODULE_NAME} and @code{MODULE_VERSION}
should follow:

@example
#define MODULE_NAME     "flite"
#define MODULE_VERSION  "0.1"
@end example

If you want to use the @code{DBG(message)} macro from @code{module_utils.c}
to print out debugging messages, you should insert these two lines. (Please
don't use printf for debugging, this doesn't work with threads!)
(You will later have to actually start debugging in @code{module_load()})

@example
#define DEBUG_MODULE 0  /* Switch to 1 for debugging */
DECLARE_DEBUG_FILE("/tmp/debug-flite");
@end example

You also have to define the function prototypes, first for your
own functions you use in your module internals, and then also
the public functions which are passed to the OutputModule
structure. You can do this easily by using the macro
@code{DECLARE_MODULE_PROTOTYPES()} (See module_utils.c
for the expansion.)

@example
/* Public function prototypes */
DECLARE_MODULE_PROTOTYPES();
@end example

When these prototypes are defined, you can finally define
the OutputModule structure for your plugin, again, it can
be easily done using a macro (recommended: see module_utils.c
for the expansion).

@example
DECLARE_MODINFO("flite", "Flite software synthesizer v. 1.2");
@end example

You should specify the name of your output module, which should
coincide with the filename of that plugin, in the first
parameter and a short description in the second one, together
with the version of the @emph{synthesizer} this plugin is
intended for. The version of your @emph{plugin} will be appended
automatically from MODULE_VERSION.

Optionally, if your output module requires some special configuration,
apart from defining voices (they are handled differently, see bellow),
you can declare the requested option here. It will expand into a dotconf
callback and declaration of the variable.

(You will later have to actually register these options for
Speech Dispatcher in @code{module_load()})

There are currently 4 types of possible configuration options:

@itemize
@item @code{MOD_OPTION_1_INT(name);   /* Set up `int name' */}
@item @code{MOD_OPTION_1_STR(name);   /* Set up `char* name' */}
@item @code{MOD_OPTION_2(name);       /* Set up `char *name[2]' */}
@item @code{MOD_OPTION_@{2,3@}_HT(name);  /* Set up a hash table */}
@end itemize

@xref{Output Modules Configuration}.

For example Flite uses 2 options:
@example
MOD_OPTION_1_INT(FliteMaxChunkLenght);
MOD_OPTION_1_STR(FliteDelimiters);
@end example

This is the end of the declarations section, take a deep breath, function
definitions follow.

Every output module is being started in 2 phases: @emph{loading} and @emph{initialization}.
The goal of loading is to pass Speech Dispatcher a pointer to OutputModule,
init debugging and register the configuration options. In the later phase,
initialization, all the configuration has been read yet and the output module
can accomplish the rest (check if the synthesizer works, set up threads etc.).

You should start by the definition of @code{module_load()}. Note that
this function @emph{can't} be static in order to be able to load the
module!

@example
OutputModule* module_load(configoption_t **options, int *num_options)@{
@end example

First of all, you should start debugging, if you decided to use 
the DBG() macro. @code{module_utils.c} offers this macro:

@example
    INIT_DEBUG_FILE();
@end example

So, lets finally register the configuration options. If you
use the @code{module_utils.c} macros, you don't have to
touch the parameters @code{options} and @code{num_options}
directly. If you don't, please see @code{module_utils.c}
and DotConf documentation for more details.

Just use these macros:
@itemize
        @item MOD_OPTION_1_INT_REG(name, default);  /* for integer parameters */
        @item MOD_OPTION_1_STR_REG(name, default);  /* for string parameters */
        @item MOD_OPTION_MORE_REG(name);   /* for an array of strings */
        @item MOD_OPTION_HT_REG(name);     /* for hash tables */
@end itemize

Again, example from Flite:
@example
    MOD_OPTION_1_INT_REG(FliteMaxChunkLenght, 300);
    MOD_OPTION_1_STR_REG(FliteDelimiters, ".");
@end example

If you want to enable the mechanism for setting
voices through AddVoice, use this function (for
an example see @code{festival.c}):

@example
    module_register_settings_voices(&module_info);
@end example

@xref{Output Modules Configuration}.

At this place, before terminating, Flite prints it's first debugging message:

@example
    DBG("module_load()\n");
@end example

The last thing you have to do here is return the module's OutputModule
structure.

@example
    return &module_info;
@}
@end example

The second phase of starting an output module is handled by
(also @emph{non-static}):

@example
int module_init(void)@{
[...]
@}
@end example

The body of this function is entirely up to you. You should do all
the necessary initialization of the particular synthesizer.
All declared configuration variables and configuration hash
tables, together with the definition of voices, are filled
with their values (either default or read from configuration),
so you can use them yet.

This function should return 0 if the module was initialized
successfully, or -1 if some failure was encountered. In
this case, you should clean up everything, cancel threads,
deallocate memory etc, no more functions of this output
module will be touched (except for other tries to load
and initialize the module).

Example from Flite:

@example
    /* Init flite and register a new voice */
    flite_init();
    flite_voice = register_cmu_us_kal();

    if (flite_voice == NULL)@{
        DBG("Couldn't register the basic kal voice.\n");
        return -1;
    @}
    [...]
@end example

Now you have to define the synthesis control functions
@code{module_write}, @code{module_stop} etc.  See @ref{Output Module
Functions} and try to implement it somehow.  If it doesn't work (and
it will probably not), it's most likely not your fault, complain!
This manual is not complete and the instructions in this sections
aren't either. Get in touch with us and together we can figure out
what's wrong, fix it and then warn others in this manual.

@node Output Module Functions,  , How to Write New Output Module, Output Modules
@subsection Output Module Functions

Note that all these functuions have to be declared as static,
so that they don't mix with other output modules.

@deffn {Output Module Functions} static gint module_write (const gchar *data, size_t bytes, TFDSetElement* set)
@findex module_write()

This is the function where actual speech output is produced. It is called
every time Speech Dispatcher decides to send a message to synthesis. The data
of length @var{len} are passed in @var{data}. Additionally, the structure
containing settings associated to this particular message is passed,
although only few options are important for output modules.

Each output module should take care of setting the output device to these parameters
(the other ones are handled independently in other parts of Speech Dispatcher):

@itemize @bullet
@item (signed int) set->speed
@item (signed int) set->pitch
@item (char*) set->language
@item (int) set->voice_type
@end itemize

Speed and pitch are values between -100 and 100 included. 0 is the default
value that represents normal speech flow. So -100 is the slowest (or lowest)
and +100 is the fastest (or highest) speech.

The language parameter is given as a null-terminated string containing 
the name of the language according to RFC 1776 (en, cs, fr, ...). If the
requested language is not supported by this synthesizer, it's ok to abort
and return 0, because that's an error in user settings.

voice_type is used only when the output module supports more types of voices
for this particular language. The values represent (from @file{intl/fdset.h})

@example
typedef enum @{
    NO_VOICE = 0,
    MALE1 = 1,
    MALE2 = 2,
    MALE3 = 3,
    FEMALE1 = 4,
    FEMALE2 = 5,
    FEMALE3 = 6,
    CHILD_MALE = 7,
    CHILD_FEMALE = 8
@}EVoiceType;
@end example

We can consider also other voice types. 

This function should return 0 if it fails and 1 if the delivery
to the synthesis is successful. It should return immediately,
because otherwise, it would block stopping, priority handling
and other important things in Speech Dispatcher.

If there is a need to stay longer, you
should create a separate thread or process. This is for example
the case of some software synthesizers who use a blocking
function (eg. spd_audio_play) or hardware devices that have
to send data to output modules at some particular speed. Note
that if you use threads for that purpose, you have to set them
to ignore all signals. See @code{flite.c} for reference.
@end deffn

@deffn {Output module function}  {static gint module_stop} (void)
@findex synthesizer_stop()

This function should stop the synthesis of the currently spoken message
immediately and throw away the rest of the message.

It should return 0 on success, -1 otherwise.
@end deffn

@deffn {Output module function}  {static size_t synthesizer_pause} (void)
@findex module_pause()

This function should stop speaking on the synthesizer (or sending
data to soundcard) and return the position where the text was
interrupted.

This may be a different approach of what you would
expect on the first sight, but it's important to understand that
simply sending some @@pause to the output device won't work.
In Speech Dispatcher, these requests for pause are handled on a
client-per-client basis, so the output device can't be blocked
for other clients. For example, a user can pause the text in
Emacs buffer in order to, say, check new mail. If the output
device would be blocked by the Emacs pause, he couldn't check
his email, because there would be no output.

It's ok not to return the exact text position in precission of letters,
you can for example take sentences as units. Also, this function
can be blocking for a short time, so you can wait till the last
sentence is said and then return the text from the end of this
sentence. 

For some software synthesizer the desired effect can be archieved in this way:
When @code{module_write()} is called, you execute a separate
process and pass it the requested message. This process
cuts the message into sentences and then runs in a loop
and sends these pieces to synthesis. If a signal arrives
from @code{module_pause()}, you set a flag and stop that loop
at the point where next piece of text would be synthesized.
Instead, you return the rest of the unprocessed text to
@code{module_pause()}.

It's generally better if the ``returned text'' overlays
a little bit with what was actually said than if there is
a gap.

If the given output device doesn't support synchronization
(@pxref{synthesizer_is_speaking}), it should execute STOP on the output
device and return 0.

It's not an error if this function is called when the device
is not speaking. In this case, it should return 0.
@end deffn

@deffn {Output module function}  {static gint module_is_speaking} (void)
@findex module_is_speaking()
@anchor{synthesizer_is_speaking}

This function is very important to let Speech Dispatcher know how to
regulate the speech flow between different queues, programs and even
other synthesizers. On calling it, the output module must decide
whether there is currently any output being produced in the speakers.

It should return 0 if the synthesis is silent, 1 if it is speaking.

This can be a very hard problem and it's not clear how to do it
with different synthesizers that don't support backward communication.
Sometimes maybe there is a possibility to calculate a good estimate
(one second or so), but if there is really no way how to tell,
it can also return 2 for ``don't know''. The usefulness of such
output module would be highly reduced: there will be problems in
cooperating with other output devices, no real possibility to
use sound-mapped sound icons, priorities wouldn't sometimes work,
it will sometimes cut-off text etc.

You should do your best to get it working (sometimes there are
not-obvious ways around), but if this effort fails, it's better
to return 2 than a bad estimate (which can cause yet a greater damage).
Not that such a module is still useful, because the user can map all
his sound-icons to text, use only this output device etc.

This function should return very fast, because Speech Dispatcher calls
it very often for different purposes.

@end deffn

@deffn {Output module function}  {static gint module_close} (void)
@findex module_close()

This function is called when Speech Dispatcher terminates.  The output
module should terminate all threads and processes, free all resources,
close all sockets etc.  Never assume this function is called only when
Speech Dispatcher terminates and exit(0) will do the work for you.  It's
perfectly ok for Speech Dispatcher to load, unload or reload output modules
in the middle of it's run.

It should return 0 on success, -1 otherwise.

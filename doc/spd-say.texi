@chapter General

@code{spd-say} is a very simple client for Speech Dispatcher that takes some text from the
command line and some simple parameters and passes them to Speech Dispatcher
for synthesis. The resulting synthesized speech is then played on your speakers.
It can also be used for stopping and cancelling speech on Speech Dispatcher.

Usage: @code{spd-say [options] ["some text"]}


@table @code
@item -r or --rate
Set the rate of the speech (between -100 and +100, default see below).
@item -p or --pitch
Set the pitch of the speech (between -100 and +100, default see below).
@item -R or --pitch-range
Set the pitch range of the speech (between -100 and +100, default see below).
@item -i or --volume
Set the volume (intensity) of the speech (between -100 and +100, default see below).
@item -o or --output-module
Set the output module.  Default see below.
@item -O or --list-output-modules
List the output modules that are available with the current server.
@item -I or --sound-icon
Play the sound icon.
@item -l or --language
Set the language. The parameter is an iso language code, like @code{en} or
@code{cs}, possibly with a region qualification, like @code{en-US} or @code{en-GB}.
Default see below.
@item -t or --voice-type
Set the preferred voice type (male1, male2, male3, female1, female2,
female3, child_male, child_female).
@item -L or --list-synthesis-voices
List the ''synthesis voices'' supported by an output module.
If no -o option is supplied, -L displays
the synthesis voices provided by the default output module.  Otherwise,
it displays the synthesis voices provided by the chosen module.
@item -y or --synthesis-voice
Set the synthesis voice.  The synthesis voice is an attribute of the
chosen synthesizer.  Most users will probably not wish to set it, but
this setting is provided for completeness.
@item -m or --punctuation-mode
Set the punctuation mode (none, some, all).  Default see below.
@item -s or --spelling
Spell the message.
@item -x or --ssml
Set SSML mode on (default: off).  The text contains SSML markup.
@item -e or --pipe-mode
Set pipe mode on (default: off).  Reads text from stdin, writes to stdout, and also
sends to Speech Dispatcher.
@item -w or --wait
Wait till the end of speaking the message. In this mode, spd-say returns only after
the message is fully spoken on the speakers or after it gets discarded.
@item -S or --stop
Stop the previous message in Speech Dispatcher (regardless of the client who sent
it and it's priority) before saying the specified message. If no message is specified,
it just performs the stop function.
@item -C or --cancel
Similar to @code{-S}, but it stops (cancels) all the messages in all the queues in
Speech Dispatcher. Use this for total stop of speech.
@item -v or --version
Print version and copyright info.
@item -h or --help
Print a short help message.
@end table

Defaults for rate, pitch, and volume are determined by @code{DefaultRate},
@code{DefaultPitch}, and @code{DefaultVolume} settings in the @code{speechd.conf} file.
Factory defaults are 0, 0, and 100 respectively.

The default language code is determined by the @code{DefaultLanguage} setting in
the @code{speechd.conf} file.  Factory default is @code{en-US} (American English).

The default output module is determined by the @code{LanguageDefaultModule}
setting in the @code{speechd.conf} file.  Factory default is @code{flite}.

The default punctuation mode is determined by the @code{DefaultPunctuationMode}
setting in the @code{speechd.conf} file.  Factory default is @code{none}.

@chapter Pipe Mode

In pipe mode (option @code{--pipe-mode} or @code{-e}), spd-say reads text from stdin, writes to stdout,
and also sends the text to Speech Dispatcher.  Example:

@example
 $ cat README | spd-say -e
@end example

If a line begins with the characters
@emph{!-!}, the line is sent to Speech Dispatcher as a SSIP command.  Example:

@example
 $ spd-say --pipe-mode
 The quality of mercy is not strained.
 !-!SET SELF VOICE FEMALE1
 It droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven
 Upon the place beneath: it is twice blest;
 !-!SET SELF RATE 50
 It blesseth him that gives and him that takes.
 ^D
@end example

Note that each line of input is individually sent to Speech Dispatcher, therefore
in the example above, the word @emph{heaven} is taken as the end of a sentence.
It should be possible to use other text filtering utilities, such as @code{tr}
or @code{fmt} to compensate.  For example, the following command would clean
up most cases:

@example
 $ cat INSTALL | fmt -u -w 1500 | spd-say -e
@end example

If the text itself contains @emph{!-!}, just make sure it is not at the start
of the line to prevent it from being interpreted as a SSIP command.  The following
sed command will do the job:

@example
 $ cat myfile | sed -e 's/^!-!/ !-!/g' - | spd-say -e
@end example

The input is sent to Speech Dispatcher as fast as it will accept and queue it.
To wait for each line to be spoken, use the @code{--wait} or @code{-w} option.  Example:

@example
 $ spd-say --pipe-mode -w
 This line is spoken and processing waits for speaking to finish
 before this line is sent to Speech Dispatcher.
 ^D
@end example

You can abort a long speech narative with the @code{--cancel} or @code{-C} option.

@example
 $ spd-say -C
@end example

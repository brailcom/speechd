The requirements:
=================

You will need these components to compile Speech Daemon: 
 - glib 2.0
 - libdotconf 1.0
 - pthreads
 - libasound1 (0.5.8)
 - gcc and GNU make
 - flite [the only synthetiser that has working output module now]
 - ncurses [for Speech Deamon Center]
 - automake 1.7+, autoconf, pkg-config and libtool (if you are building from CVS)

Building Speech Deamon:
=======================

To compile the whole project, including Speech Deamon server, all modules
and clients, simply extract the distribution archive and change to 
speechd-<version> directory and run "make all" command as follows:

 $ tar -xzvf speechd-@VERSION.tar.gz
 $ cd speechd-@VERSION
 $ make all

But before typing make all, make sure that you have correctly installed flite!
You should have configured flite with
    ./configure --enable-shared
to be able to use the flite plug-in. If you aren't sure if you have done this,
check for example for libflite_cmu_us_kal.so in your library directory.
(It's also possible to use Speech Deamon with Flite static libraries,
but it is generally not a good way unless you know what you are doing.)

If it doesn't work, try the following:

 $ cd speechd-@VERSION
 $ aclocal && autoconf && autoheader && automake -a && automake
 $ ./configure
 $ make

(You can use ./build.sh instead of the auto-toolchain) 

When everything worked ok, you can install all the parts to the default
path by running:

 $ make install

If you think something is missing, try additionally:

 $ mkdir PREFIX/etc/speechd
 $ cp -r config PREFIX/etc/speechd
 $ mkdir PREFIX/include
 $ cp clients/libspeechd.h PREFIX/include/

where PREFIX is your installation path prefix (defaulting to /usr/local).

Building in more detail:
========================

The hierarchy of Makefiles is used to build each of the parts. The top
level Makefile allows you to compile some extra parts of the project.
These are:

    - doc ........ build documentation in all supported formats
                   (see doc/README for more information)
    - src/server ..... build speachd server - this is the same as
                   cd src/server; make all
    - src/modules .... build all speachd modules - this is the same as
                   cd src/modules; make all
    - src/clients .... build all clients - this is the same as
                   cd src/clients; make all
    - clean ...... remove all files except the sources (does not
                   clean documentation)
    - all ........ build server, modules and clients

@ Test stop and pause functions in Speech Dispatcher.

@ Note that not all synthesizers (output modules) support effective
@ stop and pause.  If they do not, they should at least not crash
@ or mangle the speech.

@ We'll begin by queueing a paragraph, waiting 2 seconds, stopping,
@ and then queueing another message.  The paragraph contains several
@ sentences.  If stop is working well, the speech should stop instantly,
@ even if in the middle of a sentence.  The second message should
@ not be prevented from being heard.

When in the Course of human events it becomes necessary for one people
to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another
and to assume among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station
to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God entitle them, a decent
respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the
causes which impel them to the separation.

@ Now we'll queue another request, pause it two seconds later, wait
@ 8 seconds, and resume.  If working well, the pause should occur on
@ a sentence boundary. It is acceptable if it pauses immediately,
@ like a stop, but when resumed, it should repeat the last partial
@ sentence.

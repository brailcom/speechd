IMPORTANT INFORMATION ON THE BARATINOO MODULE
---------------------------------------------

The Baratinoo engine library (libbaratinoo) does NOT provide ABI
stability.  This is mitigated in the baratinoo module code using both
static and dynamic compatibility strategies.

Before hacking on anything *USING* or *RELATED* to the Baratinoo API,
carefully read the "Baratinoo API" section in the module source code,
baratinoo.c.

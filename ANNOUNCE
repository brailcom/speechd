Speech Dispatcher 0.6.7
=======================

The Brailcom organization is happy to announce the availability of
Speech Dispatcher 0.6.7 developed as a part of the Free(b)Soft
project. This is a minor release, it contains mostly bugfixes.  Please
read `NOTES' bellow.

* What is Speech Dispatcher?

  Speech Dispatcher is a device independent layer for speech
  synthesis, developed with the goal of making the usage of speech
  synthesis easier for application programmers. It takes care of most
  of the tasks necessary to solve in speech enabled applications. What
  is a very high level GUI library to graphics, Speech Dispatcher is
  to speech synthesis.

  Key Speech Dispatcher features are:

  - Message priority model that allows multiple simultaneous
    connections to Speech Dispatcher from one or more clients
    and tries to provide the user with the most important messages.

  - Different output modules that talk to different synthesizers
    so that the programmer doesn't need to care which particular
    synthesizer is being used. Currently Festival, Flite, Epos, Espeak
    and (non-free) Dectalk software, IBM TTS are supported. Festival
    is an advanced Free Software synthesizer supporting various languages.
    Espeak is a very fast multi-lingual synthesizer.

  - Client-based configuration allows users to configure different
    settings for different clients that connect to Speech Dispatcher.

  - Simple interface for programs written in C, C++ provided through a
    shared library. Python, Common Lisp and Guile interface. An Elisp library
    is developed as a sperate project speechd-el. Possibly an interface
    to any other language can be developed.

* What is new in 0.6.7?

 - Dummy output module which attempts to play a pre-recorded help
   message via various sound systems when all other modules fail.

 - Setting of prefered audio output method is now centralized in speechd.conf.

 - Volume settings in Pulse Audio

 - Punctuation mechanism in IBM TTS is now configurable

 - Bugfixes.

 NOTES (0.6.7)

   - There are changes in the configuration file since the previous
     release. It is highly recommended to replace your speechd.conf
     file with the speechd.conf provided in this package and copy your
     settings there if you are upgrading from 0.6.6 or any older
     versions. The old configuration file should also work, but
     audio output method settings will in output modules configuration
     will have no effect.

   - By default, the communication port of Speech Dispatcher is only
     opened for localhost connections. Please see the
     LocalhostAccessOnly option in speechd.conf for information on how
     to allow connections from other manchines as well.

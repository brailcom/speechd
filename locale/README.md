* Get gettext version 0.20 or later
* Install the latest version of orca master by hand
* Download NVDA sources using this link: (https://github.com/nvaccess/nvda/archive/beta.zip)
* Extract the archive in the locale/symbolsrc sub-directory of your Speech-Dispatcher repository, which will create a nvda-beta folder
* Download the latest unicode CLDR release by clicking the "core.zip" link on this web page: (https://unicode.org/Public/cldr/latest)
* Extract the downloaded file into a sub-directory of locale/symbolsrc named cldr
* Download UnicodeData.txt: (ftp://ftp.unicode.org/Public/UCD/latest/ucd/UnicodeData.txt) and put it into the locale/symbolsrc directory
* In locale, type:

make import-symbols
```
* When some dictionaries are added, add them to the variable nobase_localedata_DATA in the file Makefile.am located in the "locale" directory.
Use the following syntax to list the new file : `lang/file.dic \` with a tab character before.
Please keep the alphabetical order.

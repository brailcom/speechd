* Click on "core.zip and download it, then extract it into a sub-directory of symbolsrc named cldr
* Download UnicodeData.txt: (ftp://ftp.unicode.org/Public/UCD/latest/ucd/UnicodeData.txt) and put it into the symbolsrc directory

* When some dictionaries are added, add them to the variable nobase_localedata_DATA in the file Makefile.am located in the "locale" directory.

# -- SSML Support --

# Some version of IBM TTS support SSML. If IbmttsUseSSML
# is set to 1, SSML will be used and advanced features like
# index marking will be working. If set to 0, all SSML is
# deleted from the message prior to sending it to IBM TTS.
# By default, SSML support is switched on.

# IbmttsUseSSML 1

# -- User dictionaries --

# IBM TTS supports user dictionaries so that you may customize 
# the pronunciation of words, beginning of words or abbreviations
# according to the language. 
# 
# IbmttsDictionaryFolder defines the root directory under which you 
# may add your dictionary files. If several languages are installed,
# you may want to create one sub-directory per language. 
#
# Three examples : 
# 
# - a single language is installed:
# place your files under IbmttsDictionaryFolder
# 
# - two languages are installed, say English and French:
# place your files under IbmttsDictionaryFolder in sub-directories en and fr
# 
# - the same language for different regions are installed, say Castilian 
#   Spanish and Mexican Spanish:
#   place your files in directories es_ES and es_MX
# 
# The directory names are listed below (DIRECTORY NAMES and EXTENDED 
# DIRECTORY NAMES).
#
# The name of the dictionary files are:
#
# - main.dct: main dictionary
# - root.dct: roots dictionary
# - extension.dct: main extension dictionary
# - abbreviation.dct: abbreviation dictionary 
#
# The IBM TTS documentation details the syntax of the user dictionaries.
# Basically, it is one line per entry, composed of key, tabulation, value.

# -- SOUND ICONS --

# IBM TTS Synthesizer does not currently support sound icons
# (audio files that are played by name when an application requests
# a sound icon).  If you have installed the free(b)soft sound-icons
# package, this is the directory where will they be found.  If not
# blank, the IBM TTS Output Module will play them if it finds a
# file whose name matches the sound icon name.  If blank, or no
# matching file is found, the name of the sound icon will be spoken.

#IbmttsSoundIconFolder "/usr/share/sounds/sound-icons/"

# -- DEBUG --

# Debug turns debugging on or off
# See speechd.conf for information where debugging information is stored.

# TODO: Change this to 0 and comment out for final release.

Debug 0

# DebugFile specifies the file where the debugging information
# should be stored (note that the log is overwritten each time
# the module starts)

# DebugFile "/tmp/debug-ibmtts"

# -- VOICE PARAMETERS --

# This table provides a mechanism for fine-tuning the voices used for synthesis.
# The dialect is chosen by the table above, then adjusted according to these parameters.
# The columns are:
#   Voice Name   - See the Speech Dispatcher manual for standard voice names.  Use lowercase names.
#   M/F          - Gender.   0 = male. 1 = female.
#   Br           - Breathiness.  0 to 100. 0 is usually used for males, 40 or 50 for females.
#   Hd Sz        - Head Size.  0 to 100.
#   Pitch Bas    - Pitch Baseline.  0 to 100.
#   Pitch Flc    - Pitch Fluctuation.  0 to 100.
#   Rough        - Roughness.  0 to 100
#   Speed        - Rate.  0 to 100.

# Volume is controlled via speechd.conf or SSIP commands.

# Application RATE or PITCH commands are relative to the settings here.
# For example, if Pitch Bas is 80 below, a PITCH command of -50 would set the
# pitch baseline to halfway between 80 and 0, or 40.

# All columns must be provided.

# The table above shows the default mapping.
# It shows the default settings in the IBM TTS Engine, as follows:
#
# SD Voice Name     IBM TTS Voice
# -------------     -------------
# male1             Adult Male 1
# male2             Adult Male 2
# male3             Adult Male 3
# male3             Elderly Male (uncomment the 2nd "male3" line if you want to use this)
# female1           Adult Female 1
# female2           Adult Female 2
# female3           Elderly Female (notice there is no Adult Female 3)
# child_male        none provided (that is why it is uncommented, by default)
# child_female      Child

# -- KEY NAME SUBSTITUTIONS --

# Maps Speech Dispatcher key names used in SSIP KEY commands to speakable words.
# The string in the "SD Key" column occurring anywhere in a KEY command
# is replaced with the string in "Spoken".  The substitutions occur in the
# order listed.  "Lang" determines which language the substitution applies
# to.

# -- AUDIO OUTPUT --

# Chooses between two possible sound output systems:
#	"oss" - Open Sound System
#	"nas" - Network Audio System
# NAS provides a better volume setting and supports playing
# multiple streams on one soundcard, so you, for example,
# can have speech synthesis enabled and simultaneously
# listen to some music. But the NAS libraries had to be
# present when compiling Speech Dispatcher, otherwise you
# won't be able to use NAS.
# OSS and NAS specific options follow.

#FliteAudioOutputMethod "oss"

# What OSS device to use when Open Sound System was
# chosen for the audio output.

#FliteOSSDevice "/dev/dsp"

# Route to the Network Audio System server when NAS
# was chosen for the audio output. Note that NAS
# server doesn't need to run on your machine,
# you can use it also over network (for instance
# when working on remote machines).

#FliteNASServer "tcp/localhost:5450"

# Debug turns debugging on or off
# Debug 0

# DebugFile specifies the file where the debugging information
# should be stored (note that the log is overwritten each time
# the module starts)
# DebugFile "/tmp/debug-flite"

# Espeak mbrola output module is based on the generic plugin for Speech
# Dispatcher. It means there is no code written explicitly for
# this plugin, all the specifics are handled in this configuration
# and we call a simple command line client to perform the actual
# synthesis. Use this config file with the sd_generic output module.
#
# IMPORTANT: The audio output method relies on an audio playback
# utility (play, aplay, paplay for OSS, ALSA or Pulse)
# being installed. If this is not the case, consider installing it
# or replace the $PLAY_COMMAND string in the GenericExecuteString below
# with play, paplay or similar.
#
# GenericExecuteSynth is the shell command that should be
# executed in order to say some message. This command must
# stop saying the message on SIGKILL, otherwise it's useless.
# You can use the variables $LANGUAGE, $VOICE, $PITCH and $RATE
# which will be substituted for the appropriate value (you
# can modify this value, see other parameters).
# The command can be split into more lines, if necessary, using '\'.

# These parameters set _rate_, _pitch_, and _volume_ conversion. This is
# part of the core of the definition of this generic output
# module for this concrete synthesizer, it's not intended to
# be modified by common users.
# The resulting rate (or pitch) has the form:
#       (speechd_rate * GenericRateMultiply) + GenericRateAdd
# while speechd_rate is a value between -100 (lowest) and +100 (highest)
# You have to define some meaningful conversion for each synthesizer

# Here's the mapping from SSIP (Speech Dispatcher) to ESpeak (v1.10):
#
#           SSIP Range  SSIP Default    ESpeak/MBROLA Range ESpeak Default
#           ----------- ------------    ------------         --------------
# Rate      -100 to 100     0           80 to 320       160
# Pitch     -100 to 100     0            0 to 99         50
# Volume    -100 to 100     0            0 to 2          --
#
# The SSIP defaults are actually controlled via DefaultRate, DefaultPitch, and
# DefaultVolume in the speechd.conf file.

GenericRateAdd          160
GenericPitchAdd         50
GenericVolumeAdd        1

# (These values are multiplied by 100, because DotConf currently
# doesn't support floats. So you can write 0.85 as 85 and so on.)

GenericRateMultiply     160
GenericPitchMultiply    50
GenericVolumeMultiply   1

# If the client program can't handle floats, you will have to
# use these two options to force integers as the parameters
# 1 means force integers, 0 means do nothing (write floats).

GenericRateForceInteger     1
GenericPitchForceInteger    1
GenericVolumeForceInteger   0

# Note that SSIP rates < -50 are spoken at -50.

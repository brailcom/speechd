# Global configuration for Speech Dispatcher
# ==========================================

# -----SYSTEM OPTIONS-----

# Port on which Speech Dispatcher should be available
# to clients.

# Port 6560

# This should be the path where Speech Dispatcher's configuration
# is stored, it's the base directory for Include commands in this
# file.
IncludePath INCLUDE_PATH

# -----DEBUGING CONFIGURATION-----

# LogLevel is a number between 0 and 5 that specifies
# how much of the logging information should be printed
# out on the screen or in the logfile (see LogFile)
# 0 means nothing, 5 means everything (not recommended).

LogLevel  3

# LogFile specifies where should Speech Dispatcher write it's logging
# messages (status information, error messages, etc.)
# Specify "stdout" for standard console output
# or a full path to some file which the log should be written to.

LogFile  "/var/log/speech-dispatcher/speechd.log"
#LogFile  "stdout"

# CustomLogFile allows logging all messages of the given kind, regardless their
# priority, to the given destination.

#CustomLogFile "protocol" "/var/log/speech-dispatcher/speechd-protocol.log"


# -----MISC OPTIONS-----

# MaxHistoryMessages specifies the maximum number of messages
# that are stored in history. If they are more, older messages
# expire.
# MaxHistoryMessages 10000

# SoundDataDir specifies the directory where sounds
# are stored by default.
# SoundDataDir "/usr/share/sounds/sounds-library"

# DefaultRate controls how fast the synthesizer is going to speak.
# It's parameter must be between -100 (slowest) and +100 (fastest),
# default is 0.

# DefaultRate  0

# DefaultPitch controls the pitch of the synthesized voice.
# It's parameter must be between -100 (lowest) and +100 (highest),
# default is 0.

# DefaultPitch  0

# DefaultVolume constrols the default volume of the voice.
# It is a value between -100 (softly) and +100 (loudly).
# Currently, +100 maps to the default volume of the synthesizer.

DefaultVolume 100

# DefaultVoiceType controls which voice type should be used.
# Becaus voices are synthesizers specific, you only set here
# a symbolic name, which, if possible, is mapped to some of
# the synthesizers voices. Please see the synthesizer-specific
# configuration in etc/speechd/modules/ to see what voices are
# defined for the different symbolic names.
# Currently, these symbolic names are supported:
# MALE1, MALE2, MALE3, FEMALE1, FEMALE2, FEMALE3
# CHILD_MALE, CHILD_FEMALE

# DefaultVoiceType  "MALE1"

# Default language with which to speak
# DefaultLanguage  "en"

# DefaultClientName specifies the name of a client
# who didn't introduce himself at the beginning of
# a SSIP session.
#
# (Note that if you see this string during working
# with Speech Dispatcher aplications as a user, it's a good
# reason to complain to the autor of said application!)

# DefaultClientName  "unknown:unknown:unknown"

# Use with caution, normally this shouldn't be changed globally
# DefaultPriority  "text"

# DefaultPauseContext specifies how by how many index marks a speech cursor
# should return when resuming after a pause. This is roughly equivalent to
# the number of sentences before the place of the execution of pause that
# will be repeated.

# DefaultPauseContext 0

# -----SPELLING/PUNCTUATION/CAPITAL LETTERS  CONFIGURATION-----

# DefaultPunctuationMode sets the way dots, comas, exclamation
# marks, question marks etc. are interpreted.
#       none    -     they are ignored
#       some    -     some of them are sent to synthesis
#							(see DefaultPunctuationSome)
#       all     -     all punctuation marks are sent to synthesis
# DefaultPunctuationMode  "none"

# DefaultCapLetRecognition: if set to "icon" or "insert_sound",
# capital letters are distinguished from other text automatically,
# otherwise only on client request.

# DefaultCapLetRecognition  "none"

# DefaultSpelling: if set to On, every messages will
# be spelled unless set otherwise. (This is usually
# not something you want to do.)

# DefaultSpelling  Off

# -----OUTPUT MODULES CONFIGURATION-----

# AddModule loads an output module.
#  Syntax: AddModule "name" "binary" "configuration" "logfile"
#  - name is the name under which you can acces this module
#  - binary is the path to the binary executable of this module,
#    either relative (to lib/speech-dispatcher-modules/) or absolute
#  - configuration is the path to the config file of this module,
#    either relative (to etc/speechd/modules/) or absolute
#  - logfile is the path where logging information should be stored
#      (most modules support debug logging, see their configuration)

AddModule "flite"        "sd_flite"     "flite.conf"  "/var/log/speech-dispatcher/flite.log"
AddModule "festival"     "sd_festival"  "festival.conf" "/var/log/speech-dispatcher/festival.log"
AddModule "espeak-generic" "sd_generic" "espeak-generic.conf" "/var/log/speech-dispatcher/espeak.log"
#AddModule "epos-generic" "sd_generic"   "epos-generic.conf" "/var/log/speech-dispatcher/epos.log"
#AddModule "dtk-generic"  "sd_generic"   "dtk-generic.conf" "/var/log/speech-dispatcher/dtk-generic.log"
#AddModule "ibmtts"       "sd_ibmtts"    "ibmtts.conf" "/var/log/speech-dispatcher/ibmtts.log"
#AddModule "cicero"        "sd_cicero"     "cicero.conf"  "/var/log/speech-dispatcher/cicero.log"

# The output module testing doesn't actually connect to
# anything. It outputs the requested commands to standard output
# and reads responses from stdandard input. This way, Speech Dispatcher's
# communication with output modules can be tested easily.

# AddModule "testing"

# DefaultModule selects which output module is the default.
# You must use one of the modules loaded with AddModule.

DefaultModule flite

# LanguageDefaultModule selects which output modules are prefered
# for specified languages.

#LanguageDefaultModule "en"  "flite"
#LanguageDefaultModule "cs"  "festival"
#LanguageDefaultModule "es"  "festival"

# -----CLIENT SPECIFIC CONFIGURATION-----

# Here you can include the files with client-specific configuration
# for different types of clients. They must contain one or more sections with
# this structure:
#     BeginClient "emacs:*"
#          DefaultPunctuationMode "some"
#          ...and/or some other settings
#     EndClient
# The parameter of BeginClient tells Speech Dispatcher to which clients
# it should apply this settings (it does glob-style matching, you can use
# * to match any number of characters and ? to match one character)

Include "clients/emacs.conf"
Include "clients/gnome-speech.conf"

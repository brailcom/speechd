# Global configuration for Speech Dispatcher
# ==========================================

# -----SYSTEM OPTIONS-----

# Port on which Speech Dispatcher should be available
# to clients.

# Port 9876

# This should be the path where Speech Dispatcher's configuration
# is stored, it's the base directory for Include commands in this
# file.
IncludePath INCLUDE_PATH

# -----DEBUGING CONFIGURATION-----

# LogLevel is a number between 0 and 5 that specifies
# how much of the logging information should be printed
# out on the screen or in the logfile (see LogFile)
# 0 means nothing, 5 means everything (not recommended).

LogLevel  3

# LogFile specifies where should Speech Dispatcher write it's logging
# messages (status information, error messages, etc.)
# Specify "stdout" for standard console output
# or a full path to some file which the log should be written to.

#LogFile  "speechd.log"
LogFile  "stdout"

# CustomLogFile allows logging all messages of the given kind, regardless their
# priority, to the given destination.

#CustomLogFile "protocol" "/tmp/speechd-protocol.log"


# -----MISC OPTIONS-----

# MaxHistoryMessages specifies the maximum number of messages
# that are stored in history. If they are more, older messages
# expire.
# MaxHistoryMessages 10000

# SoundDataDir "/usr/share/sounds/sounds-library"

# Minimal delay for saying postponed messages in priority progress (in microseconds)
# MinDelayProgress  2000

# DefaultRate controls how fast the synthesizer is going to speak.
# It's parameter must be between -100 (slowest) and +100 (fastest),
# default is 0.

# DefaultRate  0

# DefaultPitch controls the pitch of the synthesized voice.
# It's parameter must be between -100 (lowest) and +100 (highest),
# default is 0.

# DefaultPitch  0

# DefaultPunctuationMode sets the way dots, comas, exclamation
# marks, question marks etc. are interpreted.
#       none    -     they are ignored
#       some    -     some of them are sent to synthesis
#							(see DefaultPunctuationSome)					
#       all     -     all punctuation marks are sent to synthesis

# DefaultPunctuationMode  "none"

# PunctuationSome defines what punctuation symbols shoud be
# read when punctuation mode is set to "some"
# PunctuationSome  ",.?!"

# Default language:
# DefaultLanguage  "en"

# DefaultClientName specifies the name of a client
# who didn't introduce himself at the beginning of
# a SSIP session.
#
# (Note that if you see this string during working
# with Speech Dispatcher aplications as a user, it's a good
# reason to complain to the autor of said application!)

# DefaultClientName  "unknown:unknown:unknown"

# DefaultVoiceType  "MALE1"

# Use with caution
# DefaultPriority  "text"


# -----GENERIC FILTERING TABLES-----
# AddTable adds sound icons files for different languages in
# etc/speechd/. This includes spelling tables, key names lists
# and others. These tables should be sorted in directories
# according to their languages.

AddTable	"en/spelling_short.conf"
AddTable	"en/spelling_long.conf"
AddTable	"en/sound_icons.conf"
AddTable	"en/keys.conf"

AddTable        "cs/spelling_short.conf"
AddTable        "cs/keys.conf"
AddTable        "cs/sound_icons.conf"

# -----FILTERING CONFIGURATION-----
# DefaultSpellingTable specifies which spelling table should
# be used if the client application doesn't specify anything.
#
# "spelling_short" and "spelling_full" are allways available.

DefaultSpellingTable      "spelling_short"
DefaultPunctuationTable   "spelling_short"
DefaultCharacterTable     "spelling_short"
DefaultKeyTable           "keys"
DefaultSoundTable         "sound_icons"

# DefaultSpelling: if set to On, every messages will
# be spelled unless set otherwise. (This is usually
# not something you want to do.)

# DefaultSpelling  Off

# DefaultCapLetRecognition: if set to "icon" or "insert_sound",
# capital letters are distinguished from other text automatically,
# otherwise only on client request.

DefaultCapLetRecognition  "none"
CapLetRecognIcon "capital_letter"


# -----OUTPUT MODULES CONFIGURATION-----

# AddModule loads an output module.
#  Syntax: AddModule "name" filter_type "binary" "configuration"
#  - name is the name under which you can acces this module
#  - filter_type is the type of filtering (punctuation, capital_letters,
#    spelling) for this module
#          filter_generic -- let Speech Dispatcher's output layer do it
#                            (the module doesn't have to care about it then)
#          filter_self    -- the output module will provide the filtering
#          filter_none    -- this output module doesn't need filtering
#  - binary is the path to the binary executable of this module,
#    either relative (to bin/speechd-modules/) or absolute
#  - configuration is the path to the config file of this module,
#    either relative (to etc/speechd/modules/) or absolute

AddModule "flite"        filter_generic  "sd_flite"     "flite.conf"
AddModule "festival"     filter_generic  "sd_festival"  "festival.conf"
AddModule "epos-generic" filter_generic  "sd_generic"   "epos-generic.conf"
# AddModule "apollo"     filter_generic  "sd_apollo"    "apollo.conf"

# The output module testing doesn't actually connect to
# anything. It outputs the requested commands to standard output
# and reads responses from stdandard input. This way, Speech Dispatcher's
# communication with output modules can be tested easily.

# AddModule "testing"    filter_generic

# Sound module loads the sound output module. 
#  Syntax: SoundModule "name" "binary" "configuration"
# See AddModule for the description of these parameters

SoundModule "cstsnd" "sd_cstsnd"

# DefaultModule selects which output module is the default.
# You must use one of the modules loaded with AddModule.

DefaultModule flite

# LanguageDefaultModule selects which output modules are prefered
# for specified languages.

LanguageDefaultModule "en"  "flite"
LanguageDefaultModule "cs"  "festival"
LanguageDefaultModule "es"  "festival"

# -----CLIENT SPECIFIC CONFIGURATION-----

# Here you can include the files with client-specific configuration
# for different types of clients. They must contain one or more sections with
# this structure:
#     BeginClient "emacs:*"
#          DefaultPunctuationMode "some"
#          ...and/or some other settings
#     EndClient
# The parameter of BeginClient tells Speech Dispatcher to which clients
# it should apply this settings (it does glob-style matching, you can use
# * to match any number of characters and ? to match one character)

# Include "clients/emacs.conf"
